Pubmed,Magnesium Status in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,Veronese N; Zurlo A; Solmi M; Luchini C; Trevisan C; Bano G; Manzato E; Sergi G; Rylander R,"The interest in poor magnesium (Mg) status as risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing due to its antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. A systematic PubMed literature search of studies investigating Mg status was undertaken comparing AD to healthy controls (HCs) or patients with medical illness (medical controls [MCs]). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) Â± 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all outcomes. Of 192 potentially eligible studies, 13 were included (559 patients with AD, 381 HCs, and 126 MCs). Compared to HCs, patients with AD had significantly lower Mg in cerebrospinal fluid (2 studies; SMD = -0.35;P= .02) and in hair (2 studies; SMD = -0.75;P= .0001). No differences between AD and controls were evident for serum Mg. In conclusion, AD seems to be associated with a lower Mg status when compared to HCs, while the scarcity of studies limited the findings about MCs.",2016,May,Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen,31,3,208-13,,10.1177/1533317515602674,26351088,#298,Veronese 2016
Pubmed,Alzheimer's Disease is an Important Risk Factor of Fractures: a Meta-analysis of Cohort Studies.,Liang Y; Wang L,"The risk of fracture in individuals with Alzheimer's disease had not been fully quantified. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies was performed to estimate the impact of Alzheimer's disease on risk of fractures. Pubmed and Embase were searched for eligible cohort studies assessing the association between Alzheimer's disease and risk of fractures. The overall relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effects model to evaluate the association. Six cohort studies with a total of 137,986 participants were included into the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of a total of six studies showed that Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with two-fold increased risk of fractures (RRâ€‰=â€‰2.18, 95Â % CI 1.64-2.90, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001; I (2)â€‰=â€‰91.4Â %). Meta-regression analysis showed that type of fractures was a source of heterogeneity (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003). Meta-analysis of five studies on hip fracture showed that Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with 2.5-fold increased risk of hip fracture (RRâ€‰=â€‰2.52, 95Â % CI 2.26-2.81, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001; I (2)â€‰=â€‰25.2Â %). There was no risk of publication bias observed in the funnel plot. There is strong evidence that Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor of hip fracture.",2017,Jul,Mol Neurobiol,54,5,3230-3235,,10.1007/s12035-016-9841-2,27072352,#296,Liang 2017
Pubmed,Midlife vascular risk factors and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Meng XF; Yu JT; Wang HF; Tan MS; Wang C; Tan CC; Tan L,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: We examine whether midlife vascular risk factors (VRFs) are associated with increased risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a systematic review and meta-analysis of published cohort studies. METHODS: Original cohort studies were included if they reported adjusted combined odds ratio (COR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or enough information to quantify the association between risk for AD in late-life and baseline VRFs of midlife. RESULTS: There were positive and significant associations between high blood pressure (COR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.01-1.70), hypercholesterolemia (COR 1.72; 95% CI: 1.32-2.24), obesity (COR 1.88; 95% CI: 1.32-2.69), and diabetes mellitus in midlife (COR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.25-1.57). Smoking and hyperhomocysteinemia (although only one high-quality paper) were also associated with an increased risk of AD generally. CONCLUSIONS: These results strengthen the epidemiological evidence that VRFs of midlife significantly increase risk for AD.",2014,,J Alzheimers Dis,42,4,1295-310,,10.3233/JAD-140954,25024338,#295,Meng 2014
Pubmed,"Associations between Homocysteine, Folic Acid, Vitamin B12 and Alzheimer's Disease: Insights from Meta-Analyses.",Shen L; Ji HF,"The associations between homocysteine (Hcy), folic acid, and vitamin B12 and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have gained much interest, while remaining controversial. We aim to perform meta-analyses to evaluate comprehensively: i) Hcy, folic acid, and vitamin B12 levels in AD patients in comparison with controls; and ii) the association between Hcy, folic acid, and vitamin B12 levels and risk of AD. A literature search was performed using Medline and Scopus databases. A total of 68 studies were identified and included in the meta-analyses. Stata 12.0 statistical software was used to perform the meta-analyses. First, AD patients may have higher level of Hcy, and lower levels of folate and vitamin B12 in plasma than controls. Further age-subgroup analysis showed no age effect for Hcy levels in plasma between AD patients and matched controls, while the differences in folate and vitamin B12 levels further enlarged with increased age. Second, data suggests that high Hcy and low folate levels may correlate with increased risk of AD occurrence. The comprehensive meta-analyses not only confirmed higher Hcy, lower folic acid, and vitamin B12 levels in AD patients than controls, but also implicated that high Hcy and low folic acid levels may be risk factors of AD. Further studies are encouraged to elucidate mechanisms linking these conditions.",2015,,J Alzheimers Dis,46,3,777-90,,10.3233/JAD-150140,25854931,#294,Shen 2015
Pubmed,Postmenopausal hormone therapy is not associated with risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease.,O'Brien J; Jackson JW; Grodstein F; Blacker D; Weuve J,"The relationship of postmenopausal hormone therapy with all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease dementia has been controversial. Given continued interest in the role of hormone therapy in chronic disease prevention and the emergence of more prospective studies, we conducted a systematic review to identify all epidemiologic studies meeting prespecified criteria reporting on postmenopausal hormone therapy use and risk of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. A systematic search of Medline and Embase through December 31, 2012, returned 15 articles meeting our criteria. Our meta-analysis of any versus never use did not support the hypothesis that hormone therapy reduces risk of Alzheimer's disease (summary estimate = 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.66, 1.16). Exclusion of trial findings did not change this estimate. There were not enough all-cause dementia results for a separate meta-analysis, but when we combined all-cause dementia results (n = 3) with Alzheimer's disease results (n = 7), the summary estimate remained null (summary estimate = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.26). The limited explorations of timing of use-both duration and early initiation-did not yield consistent findings. Our findings support current recommendations that hormone therapy should not be used for dementia prevention. We discuss trends in hormone therapy research that could explain our novel findings and highlight areas where additional data are needed.",2014,,Epidemiol Rev,36,1,83-103,,10.1093/epirev/mxt008,24042430,#293,O'Brien 2014
Pubmed,Pesticide exposure and risk of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Yan D; Zhang Y; Liu L; Yan H,"Evidence suggests that lifelong cumulative exposure to pesticides may generate lasting toxic effects on the central nervous system and contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of reports indicate a potential association between long-term/low-dose pesticide exposure and AD, but the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify this association. Relevant studies were identified according to inclusion criteria. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using fixed-effects models. A total of seven studies were included in our meta-analysis. A positive association was observed between pesticide exposure and AD (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]â€‰=â€‰1.08, 1.67; nâ€‰=â€‰7). The summary ORs with 95% CIs from the crude and adjusted effect size studies were 1.14 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.94, 1.38; nâ€‰=â€‰7) and 1.37 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.09, 1.71; nâ€‰=â€‰5), respectively. The sensitivity analyses of the present meta-analysis did not substantially modify the association between pesticide exposure and AD. Subgroup analyses revealed that high-quality studies tended to show significant relationships. The present meta-analysis suggested a positive association between pesticide exposure and AD, confirming the hypothesis that pesticide exposure is a risk factor for AD. Further high-quality cohort and case-control studies are required to validate a causal relationship.",2016,Sep,Sci Rep,6,,32222,,10.1038/srep32222,27581992,#292,Yan 2016
Pubmed,Saitohin Q7R polymorphism is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease susceptibility among caucasian populations: a meta-analysis.,Huang R; Tian S; Cai R; Sun J; Xia W; Dong X; Shen Y; Wang S,"Saitohin (STH) Q7R polymorphism has been reported to influence the individual's susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, conclusions remain controversial. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to explore the association between STH Q7R polymorphism and AD risk. Systematic literature searches were performed in the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science for studies published before 31 August 2016. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of the association using a fixed- or random-effects model. Subgroup analyses, Galbraith plot and sensitivity analyses were also performed. All statistical analyses were performed with STATA Version 12.0. A total of 19 case-control studies from 17 publications with 4387 cases and 3972 controls were included in our meta-analysis. The results showed that the Q7R polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of AD in a recessive model (RR versus QQ+QR, ORÂ =Â 1.27, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.01-1.60, PÂ =Â 0.040). After excluding the four studies not carried out in caucasians, the overall association was unchanged in all comparison models. Further subgroup analyses stratified by the time of AD onset, and the quality of included studies provided statistical evidence of significant increased risk of AD in RR versus QQ+QR model only in late-onset subjects (ORÂ =Â 1.56, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.07-2.26, PÂ =Â 0.021) and in studies with high quality (ORÂ =Â 1.37, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.01-1.86, PÂ =Â 0.043).

Pubmed,Effect of Vascular Risk Factors and Diseases on Mortality in Individuals with Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,van de Vorst IE; Koek HL; de Vries R; Bots ML; Reitsma JB; Vaartjes I,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors on mortality in individuals with dementia. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. English- and Dutch-language studies in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched in April 2014 with hand-searching of in-text citations and no publication limitations. Inclusion criteria were original studies reporting on cardiovascular risk factors or diseases and their relationship with survival in individuals with dementia. The Quality In Prognosis Studies tool was used to appraise all included articles. SETTING: Population-, hospital-, and nursing home-based. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling, hospitalized individuals and nursing home residents with dementia. MEASUREMENTS: A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of several cardiovascular diseases and risk factors on overall mortality. RESULTS: Twelve studies with 235,865 participants were included. In pooled analyses, male sex (hazard ratio (HR)=1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.56-1.78), diabetes mellitus (DM) (HR=1.49, 95% CI=1.33-1.68), smoking (ever vs never) (HR=1.37, 95% CI=1.17-1.61), coronary heart disease (CHD) (HR=1.21, 95% CI=1.02-1.44) and congestive heart failure (CHF) (HR=1.37, 95% CI=1.18-1.59) were associated with mortality. Stroke, high blood pressure, being overweight, and hypercholesterolemia were not statistically significantly related to mortality.

Pubmed,Cardiovascular disease risk models and longitudinal changes in cognition: a systematic review.,Harrison SL; Ding J; Tang EY; Siervo M; Robinson L; Jagger C; Stephan BC,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors have consistently been associated with poor cognitive function and incident dementia. Whether cardiovascular disease prediction models, developed to predict an individual's risk of future cardiovascular disease or stroke, are also informative for predicting risk of cognitive decline and dementia is not known. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to compare cohort studies examining the association between cardiovascular disease risk models and longitudinal changes in cognitive function or risk of incident cognitive impairment or dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, PsychINFO, and Embase were searched from inception to March 28, 2014. From 3,413 records initially screened, 21 were included. RESULTS: The association between numerous different cardiovascular disease risk models and cognitive outcomes has been tested, including Framingham and non-Framingham risk models. Five studies examined dementia as an outcome; fourteen studies examined cognitive decline or incident cognitive impairment as an outcome; and two studies examined both dementia and cognitive changes as outcomes. In all studies, higher cardiovascular disease risk scores were associated with cognitive changes or risk of dementia. Only four studies reported model prognostic performance indices, such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), for predicting incident dementia or cognitive impairment and these studies all examined non-Framingham Risk models (AUC range: 0.74 to 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular risk prediction models are associated with cognitive changes over time and risk of dementia. Such models are easily obtainable in clinical and research settings and may be useful for identifying individuals at high risk of future cognitive decline and dementia.",2014,,PLoS One,9,12,e114431,,10.1371/journal.pone.0114431,25478916,#287,Harrison 2014
Pubmed,"A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Associations Between Reaction Time Intraindividual Variability and Age-Related Cognitive Decline or Impairment, Dementia, and Mortality.",Haynes BI; Bauermeister S; Bunce D,"OBJECTIVES: Intraindividual variability (IIV) in reaction time refers to the trial-to-trial fluctuations in responding across a given cognitive task. Cross-sectional research suggests that IIV increases with normal and neuropathological ageing and it may serve as a marker of neurobiological integrity. This raises the possibility that IIV may also predict future cognitive decline and, indeed, neuropathology. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to address these issues. METHODS: A search of electronic databases Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was completed on May 17, 2016 that identified longitudinal investigations of IIV in middle-aged or older adults. RESULTS: A total of 688 studies were initially identified of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Nine included longitudinal IIV measures and 17 predicted subsequent outcome (cognitive decline or impairment, dementia, mortality) from baseline IIV. The results suggested IIV increased over time, particularly in participants aged over 75 years. Greater baseline IIV was consistently associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including cognitive decline or impairment, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Increased IIV over time is associated with normal ageing. However, further increases in IIV over and above those found in normal ageing may be a risk factor for future cognitive impairment or mortality. Measures of IIV may, therefore, have considerable potential as a supplement to existing clinical assessment to aid identification of individuals at risk of adverse outcomes such as dementia or death.

Pubmed,,Fink HA; MacDonald R; Forte ML; Rosebush CE; Ensrud KE; Schousboe JT; Nelson VA; Ullman K; Butler M; Olson CM; Taylor BC; Brasure M; Wilt TJ,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize the effects of long-term osteoporosis drug treatment (ODT) and ODT discontinuation and holidays on fractures and harms. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE(Â®), Embase(Â®), and Cochrane databases from 1995 to October 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov; bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews. REVIEW METHODS: We defined long-term ODT as >3 years and ODT holidays as discontinuation for â‰¥1 year after â‰¥1 year of use. Trials were used for incident fractures and harms, and controlled observational studies were included for additional harms. Two investigators rated risk of bias. For studies with low or medium risk of bias, one investigator extracted data and a second verified accuracy. Two investigators graded strength of evidence (SOE). RESULTS: Sixty-one English-language studies were included. In women with osteoporosis, 4 years of alendronate reduced clinical fractures (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50, 0.82]) (moderate SOE) and radiographic vertebral fractures (HR 0.50 [95% CI 0.31, 0.82]) (moderate SOE), while 4 years of raloxifene reduced clinical vertebral fractures (relative risk 0.58 [95% CI 0.43, 0.79]) (high SOE), but not hip (moderate SOE) or nonvertebral fractures (high SOE). In women with osteopenia or osteoporosis, 6 years of zoledronate reduced incident clinical fractures (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.60, 0.90]) (moderate SOE) and clinical vertebral fractures (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.22, 0.75]) (moderate SOE). In postmenopausal women with unknown osteoporosis or osteopenia status, both long-term oral estrogen and estrogen/progestin reduced clinical fractures (high SOE) and hip fractures (moderate SOE). After 3â€“5 years of prior treatment, continuation of zoledronate or alendronate versus drug holiday inconsistently reduced incident vertebral fracture outcomes (radiographic only for zoledronate [low SOE], clinical only for alendronate [moderate SOE]), but did not reduce nonvertebral fractures (low SOE). Hormone therapies increased cardiovascular events, mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and other harms. Observational studies showed that long-term bisphosphonates may increase atypical femoral fractures (AFF) (low SOE) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (low SOE in 2 comparisons, insufficient in 1). LIMITATIONS: Most data were from white, healthy, postmenopausal women, limiting generalizability. Trials often had low power for incident clinical fractures. No trials compared active treatments, sequential treatments, or different durations of drug holidays. Harms and controls were inconsistently defined. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term alendronate, zoledronate, and oral hormone therapy reduced nonvertebral fractures in older women, with oral hormone therapy also reducing hip fractures. While absolute reductions in typical fractures with long-term bisphosphonates are large relative to increases in AFF, reduced hip fracture risk with oral hormone therapy appears offset by increased risk of serious harms. Evidence is limited regarding ODT holidays for fractures and harms. Future research is needed, including randomized trials comparing ODT holiday durations and sequential treatments powered for clinical fractures, and controlled cohort studies of ODT holidays to estimate rare harms.",2019,Apr,,,,,,,31216153,#285,Fink 2019
Pubmed,The association between orthostatic hypotension and cognition and stroke: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,Min M; Shi T; Sun C; Liang M; Zhang Y; Tian S; Sun Y,"Purposes: Many studies have indicated that orthostatic hypotension (OH) may be a risk factor for dementia and stroke, but the results have been inconsistent. To further ascertain the links between OH and cognition or stroke, a meta-analysis was performed.Methods: The Chinese Biomedical Database, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library database were searched (up to March 2019) to identify prospective cohort studies that examined the associations between OH and the risks of stroke and dementia among adult populations. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity. We also performed Begg's test and Egger's test to assess publication bias.Results: A total of 3490 articles were identified, and 18 prospective observational cohort studies were ultimately included. Among these studies, eight prospective studies were about stroke, nine studies were about cognition and one study reported data about both stroke and dementia. Meta-analysis revealed an association between OH and worse cognition (hazard ratio (HR): 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.35, I(2) = 69.5%). For dementia, the pooled HR was 1.30, with 95% CI: 1.14-1.48, I(2) = 31.0%. In addition, we found that OH was associated with a higher risk of stroke (HR: 1.36, 95% CI = 1.17-1.57, I(2) = 67.3%).

Pubmed,Effectiveness of interventions to prevent falls in people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.,Jensen LE; Padilla R,"A systematic review was conducted to determine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent falls in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Twelve research reports met inclusion criteria. Studies reported on three types of intervention: (1) exercise- and motor-based interventions, (2) nursing staff-directed interventions, and (3) multidisciplinary interventions. Strategies were offered as single or multifaceted intervention programs. All types of intervention resulted in benefit, although the evidence for effectiveness is tentative because of the studies' limitations. More research is needed to better understand appropriate dosages of intervention. No evidence was found for the effectiveness of prevention programs accessed as part of occasional respite care. Occupational therapy was seldom involved in the interventions researched. Because effective fall prevention programs are embedded in people's daily routines and encouraged participation in occupation, the contribution occupational therapy practitioners can make to the care of people with AD has yet to be fully realized.",2011,Sep-Oct,Am J Occup Ther,65,5,532-40,,10.5014/ajot.2011.002626,22026321,#280,Jensen 2011
Pubmed,Ethical and social implications of using predictive modeling for Alzheimer's disease prevention: a systematic literature review protocol.,Angehrn Z; Nordon C; Turner A; Gove D; Karcher H; Keenan A; Neumann M; Sostar J; de Reydet de Vulpillieres F,"INTRODUCTION: The therapeutic paradigm in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shifted towards secondary prevention, defined as an intervention aiming to prevent or delay disease onset in pre-symptomatic individuals at risk of developing dementia due to AD. The key feature of AD prevention is the need to treat years or even decades before the onset of cognitive, behavioural or functional decline. Prediction of AD risk and evaluation of long-term treatment outcomes in this setting requires predictive modelling and is associated with ethical concerns and social implications. The objective of this review is to identify and elucidate them, as presented in the literature. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic literature review was conducted in Medline, Embase, PsycInfo and Scopus, and was complemented with a grey literature search. All searches were conducted between March and July 2018. Two reviewers independently assessed each study for inclusion and disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Data are now being extracted using an extraction sheet developed within the group of reviewers, based on an initial sample of three manuscripts, but allowing for inclusion of newly identified data items (ethical arguments). Data will be analysed qualitatively using a thematic analysis technique. Potential biases in selection and interpretation of extracted data are mitigated by the fact that reviewers come from a range of different scientific backgrounds and represent different types of stakeholders in this ethical discussion (academia, industry, patient advocacy groups). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study does not require ethical approval. The findings of the review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. They will also be reported through the Innovative Medicine Initiative project: Real World Outcomes Across the AD Spectrum for Better Care: Multi-modal Data Access Platform (IMI: ROADMAP).

Pubmed,"Effect of Nutrients, Dietary Supplements and Vitamins on Cognition: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.",Forbes SC; Holroyd-Leduc JM; Poulin MJ; Hogan DB,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that various nutrients, dietary supplements, and vitamins may delay the onset of age-associated cognitive decline and dementia. We systematically reviewed recent randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of nutritional interventions on cognitive performance in older non-demented adults. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 2003 and 2013. We included randomized trials of â‰¥ 3 months' duration that examined the cognitive effects of a nutritional intervention in non-demented adults > 40 years of age. Meta-analyses were done when sufficient trials were available. RESULTS: Twenty-four trials met inclusion criteria (six omega-3 fatty acids, seven B vitamins, three vitamin E, eight other interventions). In the meta-analyses, omega-3 fatty acids showed no significant effect on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (four trials, mean difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.08 - 0.19) or digit span forward (three trials, mean difference -0.02, 95% CI -0.30 - 0.25), while B vitamins showed no significant effect on MMSE scores (three trials, mean difference 0.02, 95% CI -0.22 - 0.25). None of the vitamin E studies reported significant effects on cognitive outcomes. Among the other nutritional interventions, statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups on at least one cognitive domain were found in single studies of green tea extract, Concord grape juice, chromium picolinate, beta-carotene, two different combinations of multiple vitamins, and a dietary approach developed for the control of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and vitamin E supplementation did not affect cognition in non-demented middle-aged and older adults. Other nutritional interventions require further evaluation before their use can be advocated for the prevention of age-associated cognitive decline and dementia.",2015,Dec,Can Geriatr J,18,4,231-45,,10.5770/cgj.18.189,26740832,#278,Forbes 2015
Pubmed,Support for midlife anxiety diagnosis as an independent risk factor for dementia: a systematic review.,Gimson A; Schlosser M; Huntley JD; Marchant NL,"OBJECTIVES: Anxiety is an increasingly recognised predictor of cognitive deterioration in older adults and in those with mild cognitive impairment. Often believed to be a prodromal feature of neurodegenerative disease, anxiety may also be an independent risk factor for dementia, operationally defined here as preceding dementia diagnosis by â‰¥10 years. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature on anxiety diagnosis and long-term risk for dementia was performed following published guidelines. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medline, PsycINFO and Embase were searched for peer-reviewed journals until 8 March 2017. Publications reporting HR/OR for all-cause dementia based on clinical criteria from prospective cohort or case-control studies were selected. Included studies measured clinically significant anxiety in isolation or after controlling for symptoms of depression, and reported a mean interval between anxiety assessment and dementia diagnosis of at least 10 years. Methodological quality assessments were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. OUTCOME MEASURE: HR/OR for all-cause dementia. RESULTS: Searches yielded 3510 articles, of which 4 (0.02%) were eligible. The studies had a combined sample size of 29 819, and all studies found a positive association between clinically significant anxiety and future dementia. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant anxiety in midlife was associated with an increased risk of dementia over an interval of at least 10 years. These findings indicate that anxiety may be a risk factor for late-life dementia, excluding anxiety that is related to prodromal cognitive decline. With increasing focus on identifying modifiable risk factors for dementia, more high-quality prospective studies are required to clarify whether clinical anxiety is a risk factor for dementia, separate from a prodromal symptom.",2018,Apr,BMJ Open,8,4,e019399,,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019399,29712690,#277,Gimson 2018
Pubmed,"Type 2 diabetes as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease: the confounders, interactions, and neuropathology associated with this relationship.",Vagelatos NT; Eslick GD,"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We also reviewed interactions with smoking, hypertension, and apolipoprotein E É›4. Using a series of databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Current Contents Connect, and Google Scholar), we identified a total of 15 epidemiologic studies. Fourteen studies reported positive associations, of which 9 were statistically significant. Risk estimates ranged from 0.83 to 2.45. The pooled adjusted risk ratio was 1.57 (95% confidence interval: 1.41, 1.75), with a population-attributable risk of 8%. Smoking and hypertension, when comorbid with T2DM, had odds of 14 and 3, respectively. Of the 5 studies that investigated the interaction between T2DM and apolipoprotein E É›4, 4 showed positive associations, of which 3 were significant, with odds ranging from 2.4 to 4.99. The pooled adjusted risk ratio was 2.91 (95% confidence interval: 1.51, 5.61). Risk estimates were presented in the context of a key confounder-cerebral infarcts-which are more common in those with T2DM and might contribute to the manifestation of clinical AD. We provide evidence from clinico-neuropathologic studies that demonstrates the following: First, cerebral infarcts are more common than AD-type pathology in those with T2DM and dementia. Second, those with dementia at postmortem are more likely to have both AD-type and cerebrovascular pathologies. Finally, cerebral infarcts reduce the number of AD lesions required for the manifestation of clinical dementia, but they do not appear to interact synergistically with AD-type pathology. Therefore, the increased risk of clinically diagnosed AD seems to be mediated through cerebrovascular pathology.",2013,,Epidemiol Rev,35,,152-60,,10.1093/epirev/mxs012,23314404,#275,Vagelatos 2013
Pubmed,Hearing impairment and risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,Zheng Y; Fan S; Liao W; Fang W; Xiao S; Liu J,"Observational studies suggested an association between hearing impairment and cognitive disorders. However, whether hearing impairment is an independent risk factor or a harbinger of Alzheimer's disease remains controversial. Our goal was to assess the association between hearing impairment (HI) and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. We comprehensively searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases on January 19, 2016 to incorporate all the prospective cohort studies meeting the inclusion criteria to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis. Four prospective cohort studies with comparison between hearing impairment and normal hearing were incorporated, with 7461 participants. The outcomes of three studies were the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and the outcome of the fourth study was the incidence of mild cognitive impairment. The overall combined relative risk of people with hearing impairment to develop Alzheimer's disease was 4.87 (95% CI 0.90-26.35; pÂ =Â 0.066), compared with the control group. Since both Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment are cognitive disorders, we incorporated all the four studies and the overall combined relative risk was 2.82 (95% CI 1.47-5.42; pÂ =Â 0.002), indicating that the difference was significant. This meta-analysis suggests that hearing impairment significantly increases the risk of cognitive disorders and future well-designed prospective cohort studies are awaited to confirm the association between hearing impairment and risk of Alzheimer's disease.",2017,Feb,Neurol Sci,38,2,233-239,,10.1007/s10072-016-2779-3,27896493,#273,Zheng 2017
Pubmed,Depression and Anxiety Among Partner and Offspring Carers of People With Dementia: A Systematic Review.,Watson B; Tatangelo G; McCabe M,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Family carers of people with dementia (PWD) experience high rates of depression and anxiety. However, the factors that are associated with these mental health concerns among family carers are not well understood. The purpose of this review was to identify factors that are associated with depression and anxiety in family carers of PWD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies that examined depressive or anxiety symptoms among family caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with dementia. Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. RESULTS: Depressive and anxiety symptoms were related to demographic factors, dementia characteristics, carer psychological and social factors, and dyadic relationship factors. Some prominent factors were consistently associated with depressive symptoms across studies. Female carers and adult-child carers, rather than spousal carers, were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Carers' coping strategies and activity restriction were also found to be strongly related to depressive symptoms. Severity of dementia-related problematic behaviors was related to carers' depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, relationship type and quality were important factors associated with depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Several important risk factors for carer depression were highlighted in this review. However, a lack of measurement precision and a reliance on cross-sectional studies limits our understanding of exactly how depression and anxiety progress during the caregiving experience. The implications for prevention and intervention programs for depression and anxiety are discussed, as well as suggestions for future research to improve the quality of research in this area.",2019,Sep,Gerontologist,59,5,e597-e610,,10.1093/geront/gny049,29878117,#272,Watson 2019
Pubmed,The Relationship of Bilingualism Compared to Monolingualism to the Risk of Cognitive Decline or Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Mukadam N; Sommerlad A; Livingston G,"BACKGROUND: Bilingualism may contribute to cognitive reserve, protect against cognitive decline, and delay the onset of dementia. OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed evidence about the effect of bilingualism on subsequent cognitive decline or dementia. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and references for longitudinal studies comparing cognitive decline in people who were bilingual with those who were monolingual and evaluated study quality. We conducted meta-analyses using random effects models to calculate pooled odds ratio of incident dementia. RESULTS: We included 13/1,156 eligible articles. Meta-analysis of prospective studies of the effects of bilingualism on future dementia gave a combined Odds Ratio of dementia of 0.96 (95% CI 0.74-1.23) in bilingual participants (nâ€_=â€_5,527) compared to monolinguals. Most retrospective studies found that bilingual people were reported to develop symptoms of cognitive decline at a later age than monolingual participants. CONCLUSION: We did not find that bilingualism protects from cognitive decline or dementia from prospective studies. Retrospective studies are more prone to confounding by education, or cultural differences in presentation to dementia services and are therefore not suited to establishing causative links between risk factors and outcomes.",2017,,J Alzheimers Dis,58,1,45-54,,10.3233/JAD-170131,28387680,#270,Mukadam 2017

We performed an updated meta-analysis of all available studies to clarify this situation. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed Alzgene, Embase, and Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM) for the period up to June 2014. Finally, a total of 40 case-control studies with 4503 AD cases and 5767 controls were included. Overall, significant increased AD risk was found, when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis.

DESIGN: A new community-based cross-sectional study and a systematic literature review.SettingsUrban and rural communities in China; population-based studies systematically searched from worldwide literature. SUBJECTS: Chinese adults aged â‰¥60 years in six provinces (n 6981) took part in a household health survey of dementia prevalence and risk factors. In addition, 33 964 participants from eleven published and eligible studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the new study in China, 326 participants were diagnosed with dementia (4Â·7 %); those who consumed any amount of fish in the past two years v. those who consumed no fish had reduced risk of dementia (adjusted OR=0Â·73, 95 % CI 0Â·64, 0Â·99), but the dose-response relationship was not statistically significant. The meta-analysis of available data from the literature and the new study showed relative risk (RR) of dementia of 0Â·80 (95 % CI 0Â·74, 0Â·87) for people with fish consumption; the impact was similar among countries with different levels of income. Pooled dose-response data revealed RR (95 % CI) of 0Â·84 (0Â·72, 0Â·98), 0Â·78 (0Â·68, 0Â·90) and 0Â·77 (0Â·61, 0Â·98) in people with low, middle and high consumption of fish, respectively.

Interleukin-1A (IL-1A) and IL-1B are two isoforms of IL-1. Recent studies suggested that certain polymorphisms on these two genes are associated with AD. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is considered as common genetic risk factors for AD, whereas different studies have provided various conclusions regarding its role in AD. This study was designed to justify the association between multiple gene polymorphisms and AD through an evidence synthesis approach. We conducted a literature search to identify relevant articles published from 2000 to 2015 from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, in accordance with inclusion criteria. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the allele model. The effect estimates were summarized by both standard and cumulative meta-analysis. Finally, 54 articles with 88 independent studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Mutants in rs1800587 of IL-1A, rs1143634 of IL-1B, rs12989701, and rs744373 of BIN1 were significantly associated with AD onset. The difference effect of same single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on various ethnicities was also observed in our results.

Pubmed,Iterating a framework for the prevention of caregiver depression in dementia: a multi-method approach.,Ying J; Yap P; Gandhi M; Liew TM,"ABSTRACTBackground:Dementia caregiving is often stressful and depression in family caregivers is not uncommon. As caregiver depression can have significant effects, there is a need for preventive efforts which are consistent with the extensive literature. We sought to consolidate the wide range of evidence (using a multi-method approach) into a simple framework that can guide the prevention of caregiver depression. METHODS: Using multiple logistic regression, we derived the predictors of caregiver depression from an empirical dataset containing key information and depression scores (based on the Center-for-Epidemiological-Studies-Depression-Scale) of 394 family caregivers. We then chose an underpinning theory as the foundation of the framework, and conducted an umbrella systematic review to find possible links between the derived predictors and the theory. Last, we compared the iterated framework with known interventions for caregiver depression in recent literature to assess whether the framework could map meaningfully with the known interventions. RESULTS: Significant predictors of caregiver depression included primary caregiver (odds ratio, OR = 1.53), severe dementia (OR = 1.40), and behavioral problems (OR = 3.23), lower education (OR = 1.77), and spousal caregivers (OR = 1.98). The integrated framework derived focuses on four strategic areas: physical-care demands of persons with dementia (PWD), behavioral problems of PWD, caregiving competency, and loss and grief of caregivers. This framework is supported by known interventions for caregiver depression in recent literature. CONCLUSIONS: By consolidating a broad range of evidence, we iterated a framework to aid the understanding and prevention of caregiver depression in dementia.

Pubmed,A complication of coronavirus disease 2019: delirium.,Cipriani G; Danti S; Nuti A; Carlesi C; Lucetti C; Di Fiorino M,"COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease. However, some cases exhibit other features including Central Nervous System symptoms. In the older adult, COVID-19 may present with atypical symptoms, including delirium and its complications. The objective of this study is to describe the relationship between the new type of coronavirus infection and delirium. Systematic research (Cochrane Library and PubMed) was carried out (only upper time limit: April 2020). Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed and manually screened to identify relevant studies. Search terms used included ""COVID-19, Delirium, Dementia, Intensive Care Unit"". We manually added articles identified through other sources (i.e., key journals). Older people are at the greatest risk from COVID-19. If infected, they may present delirium. Moreover, it is not exclusive to older people. Delirium is not inevitable; rather, it is preventable. Delirium prevention programs are even more crucial in the era of COVID-19 and cannot be allowed to wither despite the challenges of integrating delirium prevention with COVID-19 care. An acute change in condition, behaviour, or mental status should prompt a delirium screen. As regards the treatment, it is advisable to use non-pharmacological interventions first where possible.

The objective of this study is to assess the relationship of IL-10 -1082G/A polymorphism and AD risk by using meta-analysis. METHODS: All eligible case-control studies were searched in Pubmed and Embase. Odds ratios (OR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association. RESULTS: A total of 2158 cases and 2088 controls in 12 case-control studies were included. The results indicated that the A allele carriers (AA+AG) had a 27% increased risk of AD, when compared with the homozygote GG (OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.02-1.58 for AA+AG vs. GG). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were associated with A allele carriers in Europeans (OR=1.27 and 95%CI=1.01-1.59 for AA+AG vs. GG), but not in Asians (OR=1.37 and 95%CI=0.32-5.88 for AA+AG vs. GG). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that the -1082G/A polymorphism of IL-10 gene would be a risk factor for AD.

Pubmed,Brief Report: Meta-analysis of Antacid Use and Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for the Aluminum Hypothesis.,Virk SA; Eslick GD,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to aluminum remains a controversial risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Antacids are aluminum-rich medications that are widely used in substantial amounts, but their association with Alzheimer's disease has not been systematically quantified. METHODS: We conducted electronic searches of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to January 2015 for case-control and cohort studies published in any language. Summary risk estimates were derived using random-effects models. RESULTS: Seven case-control studies (n = 5,468; 829 Alzheimer's disease cases) and two cohort studies (n = 842; 110 Alzheimer's disease cases) met the criteria for inclusion. Study quality was limited by imprecise characterization of the timing and duration of antacid use. Regular antacid use was not associated with Alzheimer's disease in either case-control (odds ratio = 1.0; 95% confidence interval = 0.8, 1.2) or cohort studies (relative risk = 0.8; 95% confidence interval = 0.4, 1.8). Sensitivity analysis including studies specifically examining aluminum-containing antacids did not reveal an association. CONCLUSIONS: Although the findings of this meta-analysis do not support an association between aluminum intake and Alzheimer's disease, prospective studies with longer follow-up and more precise characterization of exposure are required to definitively exclude an etiologic role for aluminum.",2015,Sep,Epidemiology,26,5,769-73,,10.1097/EDE.0000000000000326,26098935,#258,Virk 2015
Pubmed,Risk factors for hospital re-presentation among older adults following fragility fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Mathew SA; Gane E; Heesch KC; McPhail SM,"BACKGROUND: Older adults hospitalized with fragility fractures are at high risk of negative events that can culminate in re-presentations to hospital emergency departments or readmissions to hospital. This systematic review aimed to identify patient, clinical, or hospital-related factors that are identifiable at the index admission and that may be associated with re-presentations to hospital emergency departments or hospital readmissions in older adults following fragility fractures. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus) were searched. A suite of search terms identified peer-reviewed English-language articles that examined potential correlates of hospital re-presentation in older adults (mean ageâ€‰â‰¥â€‰65Â years) who were discharged from hospital following treatment for fragility fractures. A three-stage screening process (titles, abstracts, full text) was conducted by two researchers independently. Participant characteristics, study design, potential correlates examined, analyses, and findings were extracted for studies included in the review. Quality and risk of bias were assessed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. The strength of evidence was incorporated into a best evidence synthesis, and meta-analysis was conducted where effect pooling was possible. RESULTS: Eleven of 35 eligible studies were categorized as high quality studies. These studies reported that age, higher Cumulative Illness Rating scores, American Society of Anesthesiologists scoresâ€‰>â€‰3, longer length of stay, male sex, cardiovascular disease, low post-operative hemoglobin, kidney disease, dementia and cancer were factors identified at the index admission that were predictive of subsequent re-presentation to hospital. Age was the only predictor for which pooling of effects across studies was possible: pooling was conducted for re-presentationâ€‰â‰_â€‰30Â days (pooled OR, 1.27; 95Â % CI, 1.14-1.43) andâ€‰>â€‰30Â days (pooled OR, 1.23; 95Â % CI, 1.01-1.50). CONCLUSIONS: The best-evidence synthesis, in addition to the meta-analysis, identified a range of factors that may have utility in guiding clinical practice and policy guidelines for targeted interventions to reduce the need for re-presentation to hospital among this frail clinical population. The paucity of studies investigating re-presentations to hospital emergency departments without admission was an important gap in the literature identified in this review. Key limitations were exclusion of non-English language studies and grey literature.

In some cases, they are the first clinical manifestation, preceding the diagnosis of pSS by two years on average. AIM: A systematic review was conducted to explore cognitive impairment in pSS, with reference to diagnostic methods and their relationship with laboratory data and clinical manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the PRISMA 2009 checklist, we carried out a comprehensive literature search in the three main bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO (NICE HDAS interface). The following main search terms were used: primary Sjogren syndrome, neurological manifestations, fatigue, cognitive functions, psychiatric manifestations, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and neurocognitive disorder. The search was made on 14 September, 2018. References from all selected studies were also examined. Inclusion criteria were: all studies and case-reports published in any language from 2002 that assessed the association of pSS (according to classification criteria proposed by the 2002 American/European collaborative group (AECG)) with all types of cognitive impairment (including dementia). Exclusion criteria were: reviews, abstracts, secondary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SS), and all articles in which other classification criteria were used. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 352 articles, of which 253 were excluded based on the title and abstract review. A total of 54 articles underwent a full-length review, and 32 articles were excluded. Data were extracted from 18 studies and three case-reports involving a total of 6196 participants. In most cases, cognitive dysfunction was a brain fog or a mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Occasionally, an autoimmune dementia was present. The relationship between pSS and degenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), was a controversial issue, even if some investigators hypothesized that pSS could be a risk factor. Several unmet needs were highlighted. First, some of the included studies had not reported the severity of pSS; hence, few correlations between disease severity and cognitive function were possible. Secondly, the evaluation of the pathogenetic role of comorbid diseases was often absent. The lack of information on the type of dementia represented a third critical point in the majority of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review confirmed that adequate studies on cognitive function in pSS are scarce, mostly performed on small-sized samples, and often conflicting. The routine assessment of cognitive function in patients with pSS seems advisable and it will help to elucidate some of the unmet needs highlighted by this review in future appropriately designed studies.",2019,Apr,Brain Sci,9,4,,,10.3390/brainsci9040085,30991679,#254,Manzo 2019
Pubmed,Association between Î±1-antichymotrypsin signal peptide -15A/T polymorphism and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.,Guan F; Gu J; Hu F; Zhu Y; Wang W,"No consensus has been recently reached at the relationship between the Î±1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) signal peptide -15A/T polymorphism and Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) risk. Thus, our study aimed to better assess this association by performing a meta-analysis, including 4,212 cases and 4,039 controls from 29 studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the strength of relationship between ACT -15A/T polymorphism and AD risk. Overall, a borderline statistically significant association was detected under recessive model comparison in all subjects (AA vs. AT+TT: OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25, P = 0.04). But in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant association was found in Caucasians, Asians, or Africans. Moreover, after exclusion of one study which affect the heterogeneity, the ACT A allele and AA genotype were statistically associated with late-onset AD (LOAD) risk (AA vs. TT: OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06-1.48, P = 0.007, A vs. T: OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21, P = 0.008), especially in Caucasians.

METHODS: Following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42018092857), we systematically searched Medline and Scopus for cohort studies of ischemic stroke patients examining whether MRI- or CT-assessed WMH at baseline are associated with dementia, functional impairment, recurrent stroke, and mortality at 3 months or later poststroke. We extracted data and evaluated study quality with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. We pooled relative risks (RR) for the presence and severity of WMH using random-effects models. RESULTS: We included 104 studies with 71,298 ischemic stroke patients. Moderate/severe WMH at baseline were associated with increased risk of dementia (RR 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72-2.73), cognitive impairment (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.48-3.54), functional impairment (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.83-2.67), any recurrent stroke (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.36-2.01), recurrent ischemic stroke (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.26-2.88), all-cause mortality (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.47-2.01), and cardiovascular mortality (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.44-2.83). The associations followed dose-response patterns for WMH severity and were consistent for both MRI- and CT-defined WMH. The results remained stable in sensitivity analyses adjusting for age, stroke severity, and cardiovascular risk factors, in analyses of studies scoring high in quality, and in analyses adjusted for publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Presence and severity of WMH are associated with substantially increased risk of dementia, functional impairment, stroke recurrence, and mortality after ischemic stroke.

Pubmed,Transcriptional signatures of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease: What are our rodent models telling us?,Hargis KE; Blalock EM,"Aging is the biggest risk factor for idiopathic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, the National Institutes of Health released AD research recommendations that include: appreciating normal brain aging, expanding data-driven research, using open-access resources, and evaluating experimental reproducibility. Transcriptome data sets for aging and AD in humans and animal models are available in NIH-curated, publically accessible databases. However, little work has been done to test for concordance among those molecular signatures. Here, we test the hypothesis that brain transcriptional profiles from animal models recapitulate those observed in the human condition. Raw transcriptional profile data from twenty-nine studies were analyzed to produce p-values and fold changes for young vs. aged or control vs. AD conditions. Concordance across profiles was assessed at three levels: (1) # of significant genes observed vs. # expected by chance; (2) proportion of significant genes showing directional agreement; (3) correlation among studies for magnitude of effect among significant genes. The highest concordance was found within subjects across brain regions. Normal brain aging was concordant across studies, brain regions, and species, despite profound differences in chronological aging among humans, rats and mice. Human studies of idiopathic AD were concordant across brain structures and studies, but were not concordant with the transcriptional profiles of transgenic AD mouse models. Further, the five transgenic AD mouse models that were assessed were not concordant with one another. These results suggest that normal brain aging is similar in humans and research animals, and that different transgenic AD model mice may reflect selected aspects of AD pathology.",2017,Mar,Behav Brain Res,322,Pt B,311-328,,10.1016/j.bbr.2016.05.007,27155503,#251,Hargis 2017
Pubmed,Association of insulin degrading enzyme gene polymorphisms with Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.,Cheng H; Wang L; Shi T; Shang Y; Jiang L,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic degenerative disorder. It is caused by both genetic and environmental factors.

Pubmed,Personality and risk of Alzheimer's disease: new data and meta-analysis.,Terracciano A; Sutin AR; An Y; O'Brien RJ; Ferrucci L; Zonderman AB; Resnick SM,"BACKGROUND: We examine whether broad factors and specific facets of personality are associated with increased risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a long-run longitudinal study and a meta-analysis of published studies. METHODS: Participants (n = 1671) were monitored for up to 22 years from a baseline personality assessment. The meta-analysis pooled results from up to five prospective studies (n = 5054). RESULTS: Individuals with scores in the top quartile of neuroticism (hazard ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.6-6.0) or the lowest quartile of conscientiousness (hazard ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-7.4) had a threefold increased risk of incident AD. Among the components of these traits, self-discipline and depression had the strongest associations with incident AD. The meta-analysis confirmed the associations of neuroticism (P = 2 Ã— 10(-9)) and conscientiousness (P = 2 Ã— 10(-6)), along with weaker effects for openness and agreeableness (P < .05).

Pubmed,Standard and trace-dose lithium: a systematic review of dementia prevention and other behavioral benefits.,Mauer S; Vergne D; Ghaemi SN,"OBJECTIVE: Dementia is a major public health issue, with notably high rates in persons with mood illnesses. Lithium has been shown to have considerable neuroprotective effects, even in trace or low doses. The aim of this review is to summarize the current understanding of lithium benefits in trace or low doses in dementia prevention and for other behavioral or medical benefits. METHODS: A systematic review identified 24 clinical, epidemiological, and biological reports that met inclusion criteria of assessing lithium in standard or low doses for dementia or other behavioral or medical benefits. RESULTS: Five out of seven epidemiological studies found an association between standard-dose lithium and low dementia rates. Nine out of 11 epidemiological studies, usually of drinking water sources, found an association between trace-dose lithium and low suicide/homicide/mortality and crime rates. All four small randomized clinical trials of lithium for Alzheimer's dementia have found at least some clinical or biological benefits versus placebo. Only one small randomized clinical trial (RCT) of trace lithium has been conducted, assessing mood symptoms in former substance abusers, and found benefit with lithium versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium, in both standard and trace doses, appears to have biological benefits for dementia, suicide, and other behavioral outcomes. Further RCT research of trace lithium in dementia is warranted.",2014,Sep,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,48,9,809-18,,10.1177/0004867414536932,24919696,#242,Mauer 2014

DATA SOURCES: This search was applied to Medline, Embase, Cochrane central database (all up to April 2014). METHODS: All the studies on bilateral hip fractures in elderly patients published in English were reviewed and qualities of included studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All the data were carefully and independently abstracted by two reviewers, any disagreement was settled by discussion. Data was pooled and a meta-analysis completed. RESULTS: A total of 13 case-control studies were identified for the meta-analysis. The significant risk factors were female (odds ratio (OR), 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.64), living in institutions (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.33-4.85), osteoporosis (OR, 10.02; 95% CI, 5.41-18.57), low vision (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.06-4.12), dementia (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.54-2.65), dizziness (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.42-5.87) cardiac diseases (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.00-1.78) and respiration diseases (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.22-5.47).

Original available at: http://www.revistaccuba.cu/index.php/acc/article/view/126 Dementia is a syndrome that has great repercussions for quality of life of patients and their families, as well as a high social cost. A [2009] systematic review of research evidence and consensus of expert opinions showed that 36 million people live with dementia worldwide, with 4.6 million new cases every year (similar to the global incidence of nonfatal stroke). The prevalence of dementia in older Cubans is high, with rates ranging from 6.4% to 10.2%, or about 130,000 persons (1.1% of the total population). This number is expected to rise to 260,000 by 2030. The age-standardized annual incidence of dementia is also high: 21 per 1000 population, with 28,750 new cases annually. Dementia is the leading cause of disability among older adults and is the main cause of dependency, financial burden and caregiver stress. In this review, we highlight the importance of epidemiological research to obtain greater knowledge of the disease, improve health services, promote actions for prevention and early diagnosis, and implement a national strategy to address dementia in the Cuban population, itself now immersed in two processes: accelerated demographic aging and epidemiologic transition.",2013,Oct,MEDICC Rev,15,4,54-9,,,24253352,#240,LlibreRodrÃ_guezJde 2013
Pubmed,Pulmonary function as a risk factor for dementia death: an individual participant meta-analysis of six UK general population cohort studies.,Russ TC; Starr JM; Stamatakis E; KivimÃ_ki M; Batty GD,"BACKGROUND: In addition to being associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality, lung function has been linked with dementia. However, existing studies typically provide imprecise estimates due to small numbers of outcome events and are based on unrepresentative samples of the general population. METHODS: Individual participant meta-analysis of six cohort studies from the Health Survey for England and the Scottish Health Survey (total N=54â€…671). Dementia-related mortality was identified by mention of dementia on any part of the death certificate (mean follow-up 11.7â€…years). Study-specific Cox proportional hazard models of the association between lung function and dementia-related death were pooled using random effect meta-analysis to produce overall results. RESULTS: There was a dose-response association between poorer lung function and a higher risk of dementia-related death (age- and sex-adjusted HR compared to highest quartile of forced expiratory volume in 1â€…s (FEV1), 95% CI: second quartile 1.32, 0.99 to 1.76; third quartile 1.78, 1.30 to 2.43; fourth (lowest) quartile 2.74, 1.73 to 4.32). There was no significant heterogeneity in study-specific estimates (I(2)=0%). Controlling for height, socioeconomic status, smoking and general health attenuated but did not remove the association (second quartile 1.15, 0.82 to 1.62; third quartile 1.37, 0.96 to 1.94; fourth quartile 2.09, 1.17 to 3.71). Results for forced vital capacity and peak flow were similar.

Pubmed,Treatment of vascular risk factors in patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.,Valenti R; Pantoni L; Markus HS,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests vascular risk factors (VRF) play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies have found associations between VRF and risk of AD. Treating VRF in patients with AD offers a potential treatment option but ineffective treatments should be avoided in this group who are frequently on multiple medications and in whom compliance may be challenging. METHODS: Studies containing information on the treatment of VRF in patients with a diagnosis of AD were identified using a defined search strategy. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies were included. RESULTS: The pre-specified search strategy retrieved 11,992 abstract articles, and 25 papers including those identified on review of reference lists and reviews met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. Observational studies suggested that a VRF package and treatment of hypertension and statin therapy may be associated with improved outcome but these studies suffered from potential bias. The few RCTs performed were mostly small with short duration follow-up, and do not provide clear evidence either way. CONCLUSIONS: Observational data raises the possibility that treating VRF could alter the rate of decline in AD. However RCT data are not yet available to support this hypothesis and to alter clinical practice. RCTs in larger numbers of individuals with longer follow-up, ideally in the early stages of AD, are required to address this potentially important treatment question.",2014,Nov,BMC Med,12,,160,,10.1186/s12916-014-0160-z,25385407,#238,Valenti 2014
Pubmed,Nutrition and vascular dementia.,Perez L; Heim L; Sherzai A; Jaceldo-Siegl K,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to elucidate the relationship between VaD and various nutritional factors based on epidemiological studies. BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common type of dementia. The prevalence of VaD continues to increase as the US population continues to grow and age. Currently, control of potential risk factors is believed to be the most effective means of preventing VaD. Thus, identification of modifiable risk factors for VaD is crucial for development of effective treatment modalities. Nutrition is one of the main modifiable variables that may influence the development of VaD. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus databases with search parameters inclusive of vascular dementia, nutrition, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). RESULTS: Fourteen articles were found that proposed a potential role of specific nutritional components in VaD. These components included antioxidants, lipids, homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12, and fish consumption. Antioxidants, specifically Vitamin E and C, and fatty fish intake were found to be protective against VaD risk. Fried fish, elevated homocysteine, and lower levels of folate and vitamin B12 were associated with increased VaD. Evidence for dietary lipids was inconsistent, although elevated midlife serum cholesterol may increase risk, while late-life elevated serum cholesterol may be associated with decreased risk of VaD. CONCLUSION: Currently, the most convincing evidence as to the relationship between VaD and nutrition exists for micronutrients, particularly Vitamin E and C. Exploration of nutrition at the macronutrient level and additional long term prospective cohort studies are warranted to better understand the role of nutrition in VaD disease development and progression. At present, challenges in this research include limitations in sample size, which was commonly cited. Also, a variety of diagnostic criteria for VaD were employed in the studies reviewed, indicating the need for constructing a correct nosological definition of VaD for consistency and conformity in future studies and accurate clinical diagnosis of VaD.",2012,Apr,J Nutr Health Aging,16,4,319-24,,10.1007/s12603-012-0042-z,22499449,#237,Perez 2012

We performed a systematic review of the studies published in the field of neurostimulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), from basic research to clinical applications. The main methods of non-invasive brain stimulation are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. Preliminary findings have suggested that both techniques can enhance performances on several cognitive functions impaired in AD. Another non-invasive emerging neuromodulatory approach, the transcranial electromagnetic treatment, was found to reverse cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice and even improves cognitive performance in normal mice. Experimental studies suggest that high-frequency electromagnetic fields may be critically important in AD prevention and treatment through their action at mitochondrial level. Finally, the application of a widely known invasive technique, the deep brain stimulation (DBS), has increasingly been considered as a therapeutic option also for patients with AD; it has been demonstrated that DBS of fornix/hypothalamus and nucleus basalis of Meynert might improve or at least stabilize cognitive functioning in AD. Initial encouraging results provide support for continuing to investigate non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation approaches as an adjuvant treatment for AD patients.",2015,May,Neurol Sci,36,5,689-700,,10.1007/s10072-015-2120-6,25721941,#236,Nardone 2015

Such effects may be assessed more precisely in settings where exogenous estrogen administration is rare. We aimed to determine whether reproductive period (menarche to menopause), and other indicators of endogenous estrogen exposure are inversely associated with dementia incidence. METHODS: Population-based cohort studies of women aged 65 years and over in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, including ages at menarche, birth of first child, and menopause, and parity, with ascertainment of incident 10/66 dementia, and mortality, three to five years later. RESULTS: 9,428 women participated at baseline, with 72-98% responding by site. The 'at risk' cohort comprised 8,466 dementia-free women. Mean age varied from 72.0 to 75.4 years, lower in rural than urban sites and in China than in Latin America. Mean parity was 4.1 (2.4-7.2 by site), generally higher in rural than urban sites. 6,854 women with baseline reproductive period data were followed up for 26,463 person years. There were 692 cases of incident dementia, and 895 dementia free deaths. Pooled meta-analysed fixed effects, per year, for reproductive period (Adjusted Sub-Hazard Ratio [ASHR] 1.001, 95% CI 0.988-1.015) did not support any association with dementia incidence, with no evidence for effect modification by APOE genotype. No association was observed between incident dementia and; ages at menarche, birth of first child, and menopause: nulliparity; or index of cumulative endogenous estrogen exposure. Greater parity was positively associated with incident dementia (ASHR 1.030, 95% CI 1.002-1.059, I2 = 0.0%).

The purpose of this review is to systematically analyze available data describing markers of oxidative stress and antioxidants in blood from subjects with Alzheimer's disease or those with mild cognitive impairment to highlight potential interactions between peripheral redox changes and central nervous system pathology and contribute to the design of future clinical study. PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science were systematically queried to collect studies which have evaluated markers of oxidative stress, levels of antioxidants, copper, transferrin and ceruloplasmin levels in blood from subjects with Alzheimer's disease and matched controls. After application of quality measures, results were aggregated in a random effects analysis. We found that markers of lipid peroxidation are elevated in blood in Alzheimer's disease and in mild cognitive impairment, copper metabolism is dysregulated and total antioxidant capacity is decreased. While surprisingly none of the major antioxidative enzymes are significantly decreased, non-enzymatic antioxidants in blood (particularly uric acid, vitamins A, E and C, Î±- and Î_-carotene) are significantly decreased. There is significant oxidative damage in peripheral blood early in the process of neurodegeneration. We propose that clinical studies assessing cognitive outcomes after antioxidant therapy tailor interventions to individual patients' deficiencies and confirm an improvement in an appropriate serological marker of oxidative stress.

Pubmed,Combining Geospatial Analysis with Dementia Risk Utilising General Practice Data: A Systematic Review.,Bagheri N; Wangdi K; Cherbuin N; Anstey KJ,"Geographical information systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis techniques will help to identify significant dementia risk clusters (hotspots) across communities and will enable policy makers to target prevention interventions to the right place. This review synthesises the published literature on geospatial analysis techniques for quantifying and mapping dementia risk, and reviews available dementia risk assessment tools. A systematic literature review was undertaken in four medical and life sciences databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase, and Web of Sciences) from their inception to March 2017 for all articles relating to dementia. The search terms included: 'dementia', 'Alzheimer's disease', 'general practice database', 'family physician', 'AD risk assessment tools', 'Geographical Information Systems' and 'geospatial analysis', 'geographical variation' and 'spatial variation'. To date, most geospatial studies on dementia have been carried out retrospectively using population based data. An alternative approach is utilisation of a rich source of general practice (family physician) databases to predict dementia risk based on available dementia risk assessment tools. In conclusion, the estimated risks of dementia can thus be geo-attributed and mapped at a small scale using geographical information systems and geospatial analysis techniques to identify dementia risk clusters across the communities and refine our understanding of the interaction between socio-demographic and environmental factors, and dementia risk clusters. â€ƒâ€ƒ.",2018,,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,5,1,71-77,,10.14283/jpad.2017.33,29405236,#230,Bagheri 2018

Primary outcomes were annualized percent change of total brain volume (%TBV/y), annualized percent change of hippocampal volume (%HV/y), and annualized percent change of ventricular volume (%VV/y) measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for relevant outcomes. RESULTS: Seven randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (n=1708) were found to meet the inclusion criteria, including 4 mild cognitive impairment studies (n=1327) and 3 Alzheimer's Disease studies (n=381) [3 donepezil studies (2 mild cognitive impairment studies and 1 Alzheimer's Disease study), 1 galantaime study for mild cognitive impairment, 2 mementine studies for Alzheimer's Disease, and 1 rivastigmine study for mild cognitive impairment]. Pooled anti-dementia drugs showed superior protective outcomes compared with placebo regarding %TBV/y (SMD=-0.21, 95%CI=-0.37 to -0.04, P=.01, N=4, n=624) and %VV/y (SMD=-0.79, 95%CI=-1.40 to -0.19, P=.01, N=3, n=851). However, %HV/y failed to show difference between both groups. Among anti-dementia drugs, donepezil showed significantly greater protective effects than placebo regarding %TBV/y (SMD=-0.43, 95%CI=-0.74 to -0.12, P=.007, N=1, n=164) and %VV/y (SMD=-0.51, 95%CI=-0.73 to -0.29, P<.00001, N=2, n=338). Rivastigmine was also superior to placebo regarding %VV/y (SMD=-1.33, 95%CI=-1.52 to -1.14, P<.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The results favored the hypothesis that anti-dementia drugs may prevent brain atrophy in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.",2015,Jun,Int J Neuropsychopharmacol,18,12,,,10.1093/ijnp/pyv070,26091818,#221,Kishi 2015
Pubmed,"Psychological, behavioral and social effects of disclosing Alzheimer's disease biomarkers to research participants: a systematic review.",Bemelmans SA; Tromp K; Bunnik EM; Milne RJ; Badger S; Brayne C; Schermer MH; Richard E,"BACKGROUND: Current Alzheimer's disease (AD) research initiatives focus on cognitively healthy individuals with biomarkers that are associated with the development of AD. It is unclear whether biomarker results should be returned to research participants and what the psychological, behavioral and social effects of disclosure are. This systematic review therefore examines the psychological, behavioral and social effects of disclosing genetic and nongenetic AD-related biomarkers to cognitively healthy research participants. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in eight scientific databases. Three independent reviewers screened the identified records and selected relevant articles. Results extracted from the included articles were aggregated and presented per effect group. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the data synthesis. None of the identified studies examined the effects of disclosing nongenetic biomarkers. All studies but one concerned the disclosure of APOE genotype and were conducted in the USA. Study populations consisted largely of cognitively healthy first-degree relatives of AD patients. In this group, disclosure of an increased risk was not associated with anxiety, depression or changes in perceived risk in relation to family history. Disclosure of an increased risk did lead to an increase in specific test-related distress levels, health-related behavior changes and long-term care insurance uptake and possibly diminished memory functioning. CONCLUSION: In cognitively healthy research participants with a first-degree relative with AD, disclosure of APOE Îµ4-positivity does not lead to elevated anxiety and depression levels, but does increase test-related distress and results in behavior changes concerning insurance and health. We did not find studies reporting the effects of disclosing nongenetic biomarkers and only one study included people without a family history of AD. Empirical studies on the effects of disclosing nongenetic biomarkers and of disclosure to persons without a family history of AD are urgently needed.

Pubmed,The Effect of Non-Stroke Cardiovascular Disease States on Risk for Cognitive Decline and Dementia: A Systematic and Meta-Analytic Review.,Stefanidis KB; Askew CD; Greaves K; Summers MJ,"Cardiovascular disease is associated with increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia, but it is unclear whether this risk varies across disease states or occurs in the absence of symptomatic stroke. To examine the evidence of increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia following non-stroke cardiovascular disease we conducted two independent meta-analyses in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The first review examined cardiovascular diagnoses (atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, periphery artery disease and myocardial infarction) while the second review assessed the impact of atherosclerotic burden (as indicated by degree of stenosis, calcification score, plaque morphology or number of plaques). Studies eligible for review longitudinally assessed risk for clinically significant cognitive decline and/or dementia and excluded stroke and cognitive impairment at baseline. Summary statistics were computed via the inverse variance weighted method, utilising Cox Proportional Hazards data (Hazard Ratios, HR). Both atrial fibrillation (nÂ =Â 5, HRÂ =Â 1.26, 95% CI [1.12, 1.43]) and severe atherosclerosis (nÂ =Â 4, HRÂ =Â 1.59, 95% CI [1.12, 2.26]) emerged as significant risk factors for cognitive decline and/or dementia. A small set of studies reviewed, insufficient for meta-analysis, examining congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease and myocardial infarction suggested that these conditions may also be associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline/dementia. In the absence of stroke, patients with atrial fibrillation or generalised atherosclerosis are at heightened risk for cognitive deterioration. Nonetheless, this paper highlights the need for methodologically rigorous and prospective investigation of the relationship between CVD and dementia.",2018,Mar,Neuropsychol Rev,28,1,15-Jan,,10.1007/s11065-017-9359-z,28856507,#218,Stefanidis 2018
Pubmed,Disclosure of amyloid positron emission tomography results to individuals without dementia: a systematic review.,de Wilde A; van Buchem MM; Otten RHJ; Bouwman F; Stephens A; Barkhof F; Scheltens P; van der Flier WM,"BACKGROUND: Disclosure of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) results to individuals without dementia has become standard practice in secondary prevention trials and also increasingly occurs in clinical practice. However, this is controversial given the current lack of understanding of the predictive value of a PET result at the individual level and absence of disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature on the disclosure of amyloid PET in cognitively normal (CN) individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in both research and clinical settings. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of four scientific databases. Two independent reviewers screened the identified records and selected relevant articles. Included articles presented either empirical data or theoretical data (i.e. arguments in favor or against amyloid status disclosure). Results from the theoretical data were aggregated and presented per theme. RESULTS: Of the seventeen included studies, eleven reported empirical data and six provided theoretical arguments. There was a large variation in the design of the empirical studies, which were almost exclusively in the context of cognitively normal trial participants, comprising only two prospective cohort studies quantitatively assessing the psychological impact of PET result disclosure which showed a low risk of psychological harm after disclosure. Four studies showed that both professionals and cognitively normal individuals support amyloid PET result disclosure and underlined the need for clear disclosure protocols. From the articles presenting theoretical data, we identified 51 'pro' and 'contra' arguments. Theoretical arguments in favor or against disclosure were quite consistent across population groups and settings. Arguments against disclosure focused on the principle of non-maleficence, whereas its psychological impact and predictive value is unknown. Important arguments in favor of amyloid disclosure are the patients right to know (patient autonomy) and that it enables early future decision making. DISCUSSION: Before amyloid PET result disclosure in individuals without dementia in a research or clinical setting is ready for widespread application, more research is needed about its psychological impact, and its predictive value at an individual level. Finally, communication materials and strategies to support disclosure of amyloid PET results should be further developed and prospectively evaluated.",2018,Jul,Alzheimers Res Ther,10,1,72,,10.1186/s13195-018-0398-3,30055660,#217,deWilde 2018
Pubmed,Risk Factors Associated with Falls in Older Adults with Dementia: A Systematic Review.,Fernando E; Fraser M; Hendriksen J; Kim CH; Muir-Hunter SW,"Purpose: People with dementia fall more often than cognitively healthy older adults, but their risk factors are not well understood. A review is needed to determine a fall risk profile for this population. The objective was to critically evaluate the literature and identify the factors associated with fall risk in older adults with dementia. Methods: Articles published between January 1988 and October 2014 in EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched. Inclusion criteria were participants aged 55 years or older with dementia or cognitive impairment, prospective cohort design, detailed fall definition, falls as the primary outcome, and multi-variable regression analysis. Two authors independently reviewed and extracted data on study characteristics, quality assessment, and outcomes. Adjusted risk estimates were extracted from the articles. Results: A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. Risk factors were categorized into demographic, balance, gait, vision, functional status, medications, psychosocial, severity of dementia, and other. Risk factors varied with living setting and were not consistent across all studies within a setting. Conclusion: Falls in older adults with dementia are associated with multiple intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, some shared with older adults in general and others unique to the disease. Risk factors vary between community- and institution-dwelling samples of adults with dementia or cognitive impairment.",2017,,Physiother Can,69,2,161-170,,10.3138/ptc.2016-14,28539696,#216,Fernando 2017
Pubmed,Peripheral Blood Adipokines and Insulin Levels in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Replication Study and Meta-Analysis.,Ma J; Zhang W; Wang HF; Wang ZX; Jiang T; Tan MS; Yu JT; Tan L,"BACKGROUND: Although peripheral blood adipokines and insulin levels have been considered to be biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), previous researches about levels of adipokines and insulin in blood are no conclusive. We designed this meta-analysis to validate whether peripheral adipokines and insulin can be used as a candidate biomarker in AD diagnosis. METHODS: We carried out a replication study in serum by ourselves and further conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the different levels of peripheral blood adipokines and insulin between AD patients and controls. In the section of meta-analysis, the pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to compare the levels of adipokines and insulin in different groups. RESULTS: According to our replication study, there is statistically significant lower in the levels of leptin, but conspicuous higher in the levels of adiponectin and insulin in the blood of AD patients than controls. We finally identified four studies for leptin, four studies for adiponectin and eleven studies for insulin. From the random-effect model, the pooled WMD of the levels of leptin, adiponectin and insulin of AD subjects compared with the controls was -3.90 ng/ml (95% CI: [-5.68, -2.13]), 9.42 Âµg/mL (95% CI: [4.21, 14.62]), and 2.86 ÂµIU/ml (95% CI: [1.21, 4.50]), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our replication study and meta-analysis support lower levels of leptin and higher levels of adiponectin and insulin in AD patients with respect to controls, and indicate their potential values as important risk factors for AD. Further researches that using standardized assay for leptin, adiponectin, and insulin measurement are still needed to reveal the potential change of peripheral blood leptin, adiponectin, and insulin levels in AD participants.",2016,,Curr Alzheimer Res,13,3,223-33,,10.2174/156720501303160217111434,26906354,#213,Ma 2016
Pubmed,Bi-directional interaction between hypoglycaemia and cognitive impairment in elderly patients treated with glucose-lowering agents: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Mattishent K; Loke YK,"AIMS: To examine the bi-directional relationship, whereby hypoglycaemia is a risk factor for dementia, and where dementia increases risk of hypoglycaemia in older patients with diabetes mellitus treated with glucose-lowering agents. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE over a 10-year span from 2005 to 2015 (with automated PubMed updates to August 2015) for observational studies of the association between hypoglycaemia and cognitive impairment or dementia in participants aged >55â€‰years. Assessment of study validity was based on ascertainment of hypoglycaemia, dementia and risk of confounding. We conducted random effects inverse variance meta-analyses, and assessed heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: We screened 1177 citations, and selected 12 studies, of which nine were suitable for meta-analysis. There were a total of 1,439,818 participants, with a mean age of 75â€‰years. Meta-analysis of five studies showed a significantly increased risk of dementia in patients who had hypoglycaemic episodes: pooled odds ratio 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45, 1.95]. We also found a significantly increased risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with dementia: pooled odds ratio from five studies 1.61 (95% CI 1.25, 2.06). Limitations of the study were heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, and uncertain ascertainment of dementia and hypoglycaemic outcomes and temporal relationships. Publication bias may have favoured the reporting of more significant findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis shows a bi-directional relationship between cognitive impairment and hypoglycaemia in older patients. Glucose-lowering therapy should be carefully tailored and monitored in older patients who are susceptible to cognitive decline.",2016,Feb,Diabetes Obes Metab,18,2,135-41,,10.1111/dom.12587,26446922,#211,Mattishent 2016
Pubmed,Statins for Treating Alzheimer's Disease: Truly Ineffective?,Liang T; Li R; Cheng O,"BACKGROUND: Animal studies suggest that statins may have a protective effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), but some clinical trials have reported negative results. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins in the treatment of AD. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, OVID SP, and ProQuest databases to select double-blind, randomized controlled trials pertaining to statins given to patients diagnosed with AD. The meta-analysis used main outcomes such as scores on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) and secondary outcomes such as scores on the Dependence Scale, Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), and Alzheimer's Disease Functional Assessment and Change Scale (ADFACS). Safety measures included the standard reporting of any adverse events or laboratory abnormalities. RESULTS: Four studies (1,127 participants) involving patients with a diagnosis of probable or possible AD were included. There were no significant differences between the statins and placebo groups regarding the main outcomes, secondary outcomes, or adverse events. Most of the studies ignored or downplayed risk factors for cerebral vascular disease. CONCLUSION: Statins are well tolerated without unexpected adverse events. However, more research is needed to determine whether statins are effective for AD with vascular risk factors.",2015,,Eur Neurol,73,6-May,360-6,,10.1159/000382128,26021802,#209,Liang 2015
Pubmed,A meta-analysis of prospective studies on the role of physical activity and the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in older adults.,Beckett MW; Ardern CI; Rotondi MA,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing as the global population ages. Given the limited success of pharmaceuticals in preventing this disease, a greater emphasis on non-pharmaceutical approaches is needed. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between Alzheimer's disease and physical activity in older adults over the age of 65Â years. METHODS: A meta-analytic approach was used to determine if physical activity reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease in individuals 65Â years or older. Some evidence indicates that physical activity may improve cognitive function in older adults, while other evidence is inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to examine if prevention of Alzheimer's disease is possible if started at a later age. The precise brain changes that occur with the onset of Alzheimer's disease are not fully known, and therefore may still be influenced by preventative measures even in advancing age. Determining if physical activity can inhibit the onset of the disease at any age may motivate individuals to adopt an ""it's never too late"" mentality on preventing the onset of this debilitating disease. Longitudinal studies of participants who were 65Â years or older at baseline were included. A total of 20,326 participants from nine studies were included in this analysis. RESULTS: The fixed effects risk ratio is estimated as 0.61 (95% CI 0.52-0.73) corresponding to a statistically significant overall reduction in risk of Alzheimer's disease in physically active older adults compared to their non-active counterparts. CONCLUSION: Physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease in adults over the age of 65Â years. Given the limited treatment options, greater emphasis should be paid to primary prevention through physical activity amongst individuals at high-risk of Alzheimer's disease, such as those with strong genetic and family history.",2015,Feb,BMC Geriatr,15,,9,,10.1186/s12877-015-0007-2,25887627,#207,Beckett 2015

Demonstrating the modifiable risk factors of AD can help to plan for prevention of this disease. The aim of the current review was to characterize modifiable cardiovascular risk factors of AD using existing data and determine their contribution in AD development in Iran and the world. METHODS: The systematic search was done in Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to May 2014 to find systematic reviews or meta-analyses about association between AD and cardiovascular modifiable risk factors included diabetes, hypertension (HTN), physical inactivity, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and overweight and obesity. The population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated for these risk factors in Iran and the world. RESULTS: Of 2651 articles, 11 were eligible for data extraction after assessing relevancy and quality. Diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, smoking, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity were significantly associated with increased risk of AD. Physical inactivity with 22.0% and smoking with 15.7% had the highest PAF for AD in Iran and the world, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that modifiable cardiovascular risk factors could increase the risk of AD. Moreover, about one-third of AD cases were attributed to five modifiable risk factors.",2016,Jul,Iran J Neurol,15,3,164-72,,,27648178,#201,Hazar 2016
Pubmed,Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene insertion-deletion polymorphism is a risk marker for Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese population: a meta-analysis of case-control studies.,Yuan Y; Piao JH; Ma K; Lu N,"It has long been known that the polymorphisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) are associated to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Chinese population. However, consistent results were not obtained among studies. This study is aimed to clarify the association between ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (rs1799752) and AD. Literatures were searched from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP databases without language restrictions. Eleven separate studies were suitable for the inclusion criterion. The selected studies contained 2,763 Chinese participants, including 1,383 in AD group and 1,380 controls. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to assess the association between ACE I/D polymorphism and AD. Our case-control data indicated that ACE insertion is a risk allele in all genetic models: additive model (I vs. D: OR = 1.32, 95 % CI 1.07-1.62, P = 0.008), dominant model (II + ID vs. DD: OR = 1.61, 95 % CI 1.08-2.41, P = 0.02) and recessive model (II vs. ID + DD: OR = 1.39, 95 % CI 1.07-1.81, P = 0.01). Heterogeneity between studies was significant (P < 0.10) but not in stratification defined by the selection of controls (P > 0.10). After stratification according to the selection of controls, the carrier of ACE I allele remained a high risk for AD in population-based samples subgroup (I vs. D: P = 0.008, OR = 1.32, 95 % CI 1.07-1.61, P(heterogeneity) = 0.47, I (2) = 0 %).

Pubmed,A mixed methods systematic review of multimodal non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognition for people with dementia.,Chalfont G; Milligan C; Simpson J,"OBJECTIVE: Multimodal non-pharmacological interventions have been argued to have the potential to complement current pharmacological approaches to improving quality of life for people living with dementia. The aim of this review was to identify, synthesise and appraise the evidence for the effectiveness of multimodal non-pharmacological interventions for improving cognitive function specifically. METHOD: After a comprehensive search strategy including grey literature, 26 studies were reviewed. The inclusion criteria concerned adults with a primary diagnosis of dementia. Studies used two or more different modes of intervention, and measured a cognitive outcome. Due to differences in the conceptualisations of the term â€˜multimodalâ€™, a typology of modes and methods was developed to facilitate classification of candidate studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one group studies and five case studies were found. Group studies used two or three modes of intervention and multiple methods to implement them. Interventions utilised were cognitive, physical, psychological and psychosocial, nutrition, fasting, gut health, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, detoxification, hormonal health and oxygen therapy. Five individual case studies were found in two separate papers. Each personalised patient treatment utilised in-depth assessments and prescribed up to nine different modes. In 19 (90%) of the 21 group comparisons, participants were reported to have cognitive improvements, stability with their dementia or a delay in their decline. The extent of these improvements in terms of meaningful clinical change was variable.

We aim to conduct a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the risk of dementia in subjects with MCI and depressive symptoms compared with subjects with MCI and no depressive symptoms. METHODS: We calculated the relative risk of progression to dementia in subjects with MCI and depressive symptoms compared with subjects with MCI and no depressive symptoms using a generic inverse variance method with random effect models. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a sample size of 10,861 MCI subjects. The pooled relative risk of progressing to dementia was 1.28 CI95% [1.09-1.52] (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) in the group of MCI subjects with depressive symptoms compared with the MCI subjects with no depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION: Our results provide additional evidence that depressive symptoms determine an additive risk effect to the progression to dementia in subjects with MCI. The comorbidity between depression and cognitive impairment can be an intervention target for prevention of dementia in MCI subjects.

Pubmed,Midlife obesity and dementia: meta-analysis and adjusted forecast of dementia prevalence in the United States and China.,Loef M; Walach H,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a risk factor of dementia. Current forecasts of dementia prevalence fail to take the rising obesity prevalence into account. DESIGN AND METHODS: Embase and Medline were searched for observational studies on the association between overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)) or obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) and dementia and pooled the effect sizes by meta-analysis. The population attributable risk (PAR) was calculated for different time points and adjusted them for confounders. Based on current prevalence rates of dementia and demographic forecasts, patient numbers were calculated and adjusted by the growth rates of PAR. RESULTS: Compared to normal weight, midlife obesity increases the risk of dementia later in life (BMI 25-30: RR = 1.34 [95% CI 1.08, 1.66], BMI > 30: RR = 1.91 [1.4, 2.62]). If obesity is included into forecast models, the prevalence of dementia is estimated to be 7.1 million (6.9, 7.3) and 11.3 million (10.9, 11.7) for the United States in 2030 and 2050, respectively. In China, the estimate is 13.1 million (12.8, 13.3) in 2030 and 26.2 million (25.1, 27.4) in 2050. These figures are 9% and 19% higher for the United States and China, respectively, than forecasts that rely solely on the demographic change. CONCLUSION: The past and ongoing increase in midlife obesity prevalence will contribute significantly to the future prevalence of dementia and public health measures to reduce midlife obesity are simultaneously primary prevention measures to reduce the risk of dementia.",2013,Jan,Obesity (Silver Spring),21,1,E51-5,,10.1002/oby.20037,23401370,#195,Loef 2013
Pubmed,Models for Predicting Incident Delirium in Hospitalized Older Adults: A Systematic Review.,Kalimisetty S; Askar W; Fay B; Khan A,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the reported risk prediction models and identify the most prevalent factors for incident delirium in older inpatient populations (age â‰¥ 65 years). In the future, these risk factors could be used to develop a delirium risk prediction model in the electronic health record that can be used by the Hospital Elder Life Program to reduce the incidence of delirium. METHODS: A medical librarian customized and conducted a search strategy for all published articles on delirium prediction models using an array of electronic databases and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, a geriatrician and two research associates assessed the quality of the selected studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). RESULTS: A total of 4,351 articles were identified from initial literature search. After review, data were extracted from 12 studies. The quality of these studies was assessed using NOS and ranged from 4 to 8. The most common risk factors reported were dementia, decreased functional status, high blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio, infection and severe illness.

Pubmed,Common Bacterial Infections and Risk of Dementia or Cognitive Decline: A Systematic Review.,Muzambi R; Bhaskaran K; Brayne C; Davidson JA; Smeeth L; Warren-Gash C,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections may be associated with dementia, but the temporality of any relationship remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To summarize existing literature on the association between common bacterial infections and the risk of dementia and cognitive decline in longitudinal studies. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of 10 databases of published and grey literature from inception to 18 March 2019 using search terms for common bacterial infections, dementia, cognitive decline, and longitudinal study designs. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, data extraction, risk of bias and overall quality assessment. Data were summarized through a narrative synthesis as high heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 3,488 studies. 9 met the eligibility criteria; 6 were conducted in the United States and 3 in Taiwan. 7 studies reported on dementia and 2 investigated cognitive decline. Multiple infections were assessed in two studies. All studies found sepsis (nâ€_=â€_6), pneumonia (nâ€_=â€_3), urinary tract infection (nâ€_=â€_1), and cellulitis (nâ€_=â€_1) increased dementia risk (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.19) to (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.84-3.66). The range of effect estimates was similar when limited to three studies with no domains at high risk of bias. However, the overall quality of evidence was rated very low. Studies on cognitive decline found no association with infection but had low power. CONCLUSION: Our review suggests common bacterial infections may be associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia, after adjustment for multiple confounders, but further high-quality, large-scale longitudinal studies, across different healthcare settings, are recommended to further explore this association.",2020,,J Alzheimers Dis,76,4,1609-1626,,10.3233/JAD-200303,32651320,#192,Muzambi 2020

METHODS: Four authors carried out the systematic review in accordance with strict guidelines. The terms ""vitamin A"" OR ""retinol"" OR ""retinoic acid"" AND ""memory"" OR ""cognition"" OR ""Alzheimer"" were searched in virtually all medical research databases. RESULTS: From 236 studies containing the key words, 44 were selected for this review, numbering 10 reviews and 34 original articles. Most studies used animal models for studying vitamin A and cognition. Birds, mice and rats were more frequently employed whereas human studies accounted for only two reports on brain tissue from autopsies and one on the role of isotretinoin in cognition among individuals taking this medication to treat acne. CONCLUSION: Vitamin A may be an important and viable complement in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials are imperative and, at present, there is no evidence-based data to recommend vitamin A supplementation for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",2012,Oct-Dec,Dement Neuropsychol,6,4,219-222,,10.1590/S1980-57642012DN06040005,29213801,#190,Fragoso 2012
Pubmed,Mild cognitive impairment and dementia: the importance of modifiable risk factors.,Etgen T; Sander D; Bickel H; FÃ¶rstl H,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a common condition among the elderly, is defined as a deterioration of memory, attention, and cognitive function that exceeds what would be expected for the individual's age and level of education, yet does not interfere significantly with the activities of daily living. MCI may be a precursor of dementia; the rate of transition from MCI to dementia is 10% to 20% per year. The role of somatic diseases and modifiable risk factors in MCI and dementia needs further study. METHODS: We analyzed pertinent original articles and reviews published 1990 up to December 2010 that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: MCI and dementia are associated with many somatic disorders and modifiable risk factors. MCI has biologically plausible associations with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, although the interventional trials performed to date have yielded negative results. Recently, chronic renal failure has also been recognized as a risk factor. Insufficient evidence supports a putative benefit on MCI from the substitution of vitamin B12, vitamin D, or testosterone (when these substances are deficient), the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia or subclinical thyroid dysfunction, or hormone replacement therapy after menopause. Epidemiological data suggest that a Mediterranean diet, physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption protect against MCI, while cigarette smoking promotes it and should be stopped. CONCLUSION: Modifiable risk factors for MCI should be sought (at the very latest) in persons who already have MCI, as their optimal treatment may improve these patients' cognitive performance or keep the existing deficits from progressing.",2011,Nov,Dtsch Arztebl Int,108,44,743-50,,10.3238/arztebl.2011.0743,22163250,#189,Etgen 2011
Pubmed,A Systematic Review and Delphi Study to Ascertain Common Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dementia and Brain-Related Complications of Diabetes in Adults.,Dolan C; Glynn R; Lawlor B,"OBJECTIVES: Both type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and dementia have multifactorial etiologies. Both are associated with aging and have well-recognized lifestyle, cardiovascular and psychosocial risk factors. However, uncertainty exists in the literature with regard to: 1) the potentially modifiable risk factors common to both dementia and T2DM, and 2) the risk of brain-related complications in those with established diabetes. In this study, we address this uncertainty and inform design of a survey questionnaire to assess knowledge about diabetes and brain health among at-risk groups. METHODS: This investigation consisted of a mixed-methods approach, including a Delphi consensus study preceded by a systematic literature review. The review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. A 2-round online Delphi study, informed by the review, invited international experts to rate their agreement with proposed risk factors and complications. RESULTS: Of 7,337 abstracts retrieved, 13 were included in the final review. Among 46 international experts invited to take part in the Delphi study, 14 (32%) responded. In the Delphi study, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity and heavy alcohol consumption reached consensus as risk factors common to both T2DM and dementia. Proposed brain-related diabetes complications, depression and dementia were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed expert consensus and literature review agreement on a number of common modifiable risk factors for T2DM and dementia, as well as agreement on brain-related complications of diabetes. A number of other proposed shared risk factors did not reach consensus agreement, suggesting a need for more high-quality studies to add to the evidence base.",2020,Jan,Can J Diabetes,,,,,10.1016/j.jcjd.2020.01.004,32127297,#188,Dolan 2020
Pubmed,Where are we at with model-based economic evaluations of interventions for dementia? a systematic review and quality assessment.,Nguyen KH; Comans TA; Green C,"ABSTRACTObjective:To identify, review, and critically appraise model-based economic evaluations of all types of interventions for people with dementia and their carers. DESIGN: A systematic literature search was undertaken to identify model-based evaluations of dementia interventions. A critical appraisal of included studies was carried out using guidance on good practice methods for decision-analytic models in health technology assessment, with a focus on model structure, data, and model consistency. SETTING: Interventions for people with dementia and their carers, across prevention, diagnostic, treatment, and disease management. RESULTS: We identified 67 studies, with 43 evaluating pharmacological products, 19 covering prevention or diagnostic strategies, and 5 studies reporting non-pharmacological interventions. The majority of studies use Markov models with a simple structure to represent dementia symptoms and disease progression. Half of all studies reported taking a societal perspective, with the other half adopting a third-party payer perspective. Most studies follow good practices in modeling, particularly related to the decision problem description, perspective, model structure, and data inputs. Many studies perform poorly in areas related to the reporting of pre-modeling analyses, justifying data inputs, evaluating data quality, considering alternative modeling options, validating models, and assessing uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing literature on the model-based evaluations of interventions for dementia. The literature predominantly reports on pharmaceutical interventions for Alzheimer's disease, but there is a growing literature for dementia prevention and non-pharmacological interventions. Our findings demonstrate that decision-makers need to critically appraise and understand the model-based evaluations and their limitations to ensure they are used, interpreted, and applied appropriately.",2018,Nov,Int Psychogeriatr,30,11,1593-1605,,10.1017/S1041610218001291,30475198,#186,Nguyen 2018
Pubmed,Statins and cognition: a systematic review and meta-analysis of short- and long-term cognitive effects.,Swiger KJ; Manalac RJ; Blumenthal RS; Blaha MJ; Martin SS,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of statins on short-term cognitive function and the long-term incidence of dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register from their inception to April 25, 2013. Adults with no history of cognitive dysfunction treated with statins were included from high-quality randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies after formal bias assessment. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 11 in quantitative synthesis. Short-term trials did not show a consistent effect of statin therapy on cognitive end points. Digit Symbol Substitution Testing (a well-validated measure of cognitive function) was the most common short-term end point, with no significant differences in the mean change from baseline to follow-up between the statin and placebo groups (mean change, 1.65; 95% CI, -0.03 to 3.32; 296 total exposures in 3 trials). Long-term cognition studies included 23,443 patients with a mean exposure duration of 3 to 24.9 years. Three studies found no association between statin use and incident dementia, and 5 found a favorable effect. Pooled results revealed a 29% reduction in incident dementia in statin-treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82). CONCLUSION: In patients without baseline cognitive dysfunction, short-term data are most compatible with no adverse effect of statins on cognition, and long-term data may support a beneficial role for statins in the prevention of dementia.",2013,Nov,Mayo Clin Proc,88,11,1213-21,,10.1016/j.mayocp.2013.07.013,24095248,#184,Swiger 2013
Pubmed,Quantitative assessment of the effect of ABCA1 gene polymorphism on the risk of Alzheimer's disease.,Wang XF; Cao YW; Feng ZZ; Fu D; Ma YS; Zhang F; Jiang XX; Shao YC,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a membrane-associated protein which has attracted considerable attention as a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on its function as a key factor in lipid metabolism by mediating cellular cholesterol efflux, the rate-limiting step in the production of nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. The relationship between ABCA1 common variations (R219Â K rs2230806, I883Â M rs4149313 and R1587Â K rs2230808) and AD has been reported in various ethnic groups; however, these studies have yielded contradictory results. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a meta-analysis of 13 studies involving a total of 12,248 subjects to evaluate the effect of ABCA1 on genetic susceptibility for AD. Overall, the summary OR of AD was 1.01 (95Â % CI: 0.93-1.10; PÂ =Â 0.77), 1.10 (95Â % CI: 0.96-1.26; PÂ =Â 0.16), and 1.08 (95Â % CI: 0.96-1.23; PÂ =Â 0.21) for R219Â K, I883Â M and R1587Â K polymorphism, respectively. No significant results were observed in dominant and recessive when compared with wild genotype for these polymorphisms. In the stratified analyses by ethnicity and sample size, no evidence of any gene-disease association was obtained. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis does not support the notion that common SNPs on ABCA1 is a major genetic risk factor for AD.",2013,Feb,Mol Biol Rep,40,2,779-85,,10.1007/s11033-012-2115-9,23111454,#183,Wang 2013
Pubmed,Characterization of White Matter Hyperintensities in Large-Scale MRI-Studies.,Frey BM; Petersen M; Mayer C; Schulz M; Cheng B; Thomalla G,"Background: White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are a common finding in elderly people and a growing social malady in the aging western societies. As a manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, WMH are considered to be a vascular contributor to various sequelae such as cognitive decline, dementia, depression, stroke as well as gait and balance problems. While pathophysiology and therapeutical options remain unclear, large-scale studies have improved the understanding of WMH, particularly by quantitative assessment of WMH. In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of the characteristics, research subjects and segmentation techniques of these studies. Methods: We performed a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement. One thousand one hundred and ninety-six potentially relevant articles were identified via PubMed search. Six further articles classified as relevant were added manually. After applying a catalog of exclusion criteria, remaining articles were read full-text and the following information was extracted into a standardized form: year of publication, sample size, mean age of subjects in the study, the cohort included, and segmentation details like the definition of WMH, the segmentation method, reference to methods papers as well as validation measurements. Results: Our search resulted in the inclusion and full-text review of 137 articles. One hundred and thirty-four of them belonged to 37 prospective cohort studies. Median sample size was 1,030 with no increase over the covered years. Eighty studies investigated in the association of WMH and risk factors. Most of them focussed on arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II and Apo E genotype and inflammatory markers. Sixty-three studies analyzed the association of WMH and secondary conditions like cognitive decline, mood disorder and brain atrophy. Studies applied various methods based on manual (3), semi-automated (57), and automated segmentation techniques (75). Only 18% of the articles referred to an explicit definition of WMH. Discussion: The review yielded a large number of studies engaged in WMH research. A remarkable variety of segmentation techniques was applied, and only a minority referred to a clear definition of WMH. Most addressed topics were risk factors and secondary clinical conditions. In conclusion, WMH research is a vivid field with a need for further standardization regarding definitions and used methods.",2019,,Front Neurol,10,,238,,10.3389/fneur.2019.00238,30972001,#182,Frey 2019
Pubmed,The role of neurosonology in the diagnosis of vascular dementia.,Tsivgoulis G; Katsanos AH; Papageorgiou SG; Dardiotis E; Voumvourakis K; Giannopoulos S,"Although transcranial sonography is not yet an established diagnostic modality for dementia screening or differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from vascular dementia (VaD), intracranial hemodynamic assessment may provide crucial information about the association between cognitive deterioration and vascular risk factors. We conducted a systematic narrative review of available literature through MEDLINE and EMBASE search to identify all available data about the evaluation of VaD patients with transcranial Doppler, and to discuss further the vascular disorders of the cerebral circulation in patients with vascular cognitive impairment. According to the available literature data to date, VaD patients were found to have lower mean flow velocity values in four studies (indicating cerebral hypoperfusion), higher pulsatility indices in three studies (indicating increased downstream vascular resistance), and more severe impairment of cerebrovascular reactivity in five studies (indicating exhausted vasodilatory reserve) compared to AD patients and controls. Microembolic signals were also found to be significantly more common in patients with VaD or AD compared to their age- and gender-matched controls, suggesting that asymptomatic microembolism, apart for being only marker of VaD, could presumably be involved in the genesis of dementia, and in the overlap between VaD and AD. Further studies with larger and carefully selected groups are required to eliminate potential confounders and to set specific cut-off values for the aforementioned hemodynamic parameters in demented patients and dementia subtypes.",2014,,J Alzheimers Dis,42 Suppl 3,,S251-7,,10.3233/JAD-132441,24685627,#179,Tsivgoulis 2014

ChAT gene polymorphisms (SNPs rs868750G/A, rs1880676G/A, rs2177369G/A, and rs3810950G/A) may be associated with the risk of AD. In this meta-analysis, we determined the relationship between the four polymorphisms and the risk of AD. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and HuGEnet databases for studies linking the four polymorphisms with AD risk. We included 16 articles in our meta-analysis to assess the association between the four polymorphisms and susceptibility to AD by calculating the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The combined results showed no significant association with rs1880676G/A and rs2177369G/A polymorphisms.

Pubmed,The best evidence for minimizing resistance-to-care during assisted personal care for older adults with dementia in nursing homes: a systematic review.,Konno R; Kang HS; Makimoto K,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of interventions in minimizing resistance-to-care behaviors during assisted personal care for nursing home residents with dementia. REVIEW QUESTIONS: â€¢ What interventions are effective for reducing the frequency and intensity of resistance-to-care behaviors during assisted personal care activities (i.e. mealtime assistance, toileting, mouth care, morning care and shower/bathing) for nursing home residents with dementia?â€¢ What interventions are effective for reducing the frequency and intensity of resistance-to-care behaviors for overall daily personal care activities for nursing home residents with dementia? BACKGROUND: In many countries the proportion of older adults with dementia is steadily increasing. Many older adults with dementia live in nursing homes and most of them require assistance with personal care due to having dementia-related symptoms. Nursing staff and formal caregivers frequently experience resistance or rejection from such residents when they are providing care. Such behavior can be a large obstacle, particularly when caregivers attempt to provide assistance in daily personal care including oral care, bathing, feeding, dressing and toileting.The definition of ""resistance-to-care"" means physically and/or psychologically resistive behavior, for example ""pulling away from staff, tightening limbs, stiffening the body, deliberately ceasing or refusing to weight bear during care, waving arms and legs and verbally objecting to care using words and/or sounds"" (p.7). Several other definitions can be found in the literature concerning the resistance-to-care behaviors exhibited by nursing home residents with dementia. No distinct difference seems to exist for what terms mean and they are often used interchangeably in the studies on nursing. For instance, Mahoney et al. have defined the term ""resistive to care"" to mean ""the repertoire of behaviors with which persons with dementia withstand or oppose the efforts of a caregiver"" (p.28). Other commonly used terms include ""rejection of care"", ""resistant behaviour"", ""resistivenessto care (RTC)"", ""care-resistant behavior (CRB)"", and ""resistance to care"". In this review the term ""resistance-to-care"" will be used to retain consistency of meaning.Resistance-to-care behaviors are commonly reported phenomena in the aged care field. One US study reported 9% of 23,837 nursing home residents experiencing dementia demonstrated resistance-to-care behaviors and another US study also reported a similar percentage, i.e. 9.7% of 3,230 residents. From the caregivers' perspective experiences of confronting these care resistant behaviors have been well documented. A study conducted in Sweden showed 79% of 86 nursing home staff in Stockholm, Sweden reported being rejected by the residents and 96.9% of 494 nurses in 11 Norwegian nursing homes reported that they experienced resistant behavior from the residents during personal care. Resistance-to-care behaviors can cause serious problems for both caregivers and dementia-stricken residents. Caregivers experience enormous physical and emotional distress from such behaviors carried out by their residents. Resistance-to-care behaviors can cause physical and psychological injury to caregivers. For the residents such behaviors can lead to malnutrition, skin breakdown, dehydration, constipation, weight loss and other health problems. Furthermore, inability to manage resistance-to-care behaviors may cause verbal and non-verbal abusive behaviors and physical and psychological harms to caregivers. This in turn may result in residents being inappropriately physically and/or medically restrained. Therefore, effective prevention and management of such behaviors is crucial for both care providers and nursing home residents with dementia.Several systematic literature reviews have been published on the nature and management of dementia-related behaviors. Those reviews addressed topics including hygiene care in residential aged care facilities, aggressive behavior toward caregivers, therapeutic effects of music and singing, the use of preferred music intervention at mealtimes, feeding-related nursing care, and a review on interventions to promote oral nutritional intake of older people with dementia and feeding difficulty. A recently published review has reported on the relevant factors that trigger resistance-to-care behaviors.By examining previously published systematic reviews, it was evident that their focus tended to be broad and not solely concerned with resistance-to-care behaviors in the context of daily personal care. Alternatively, they addressed a specific care situation such as oral care or mealtime, raising questions whether interventions should differ for each care activity or if any interventions can be effective in daily personal care in general. Thus, the present review will aim to examine what interventions are effective for managing or reducing resistance-to-care behaviors of nursing home residents who have dementia. The review will focus on effective interventions for each care activity in daily personal care and overall daily personal care. Thus the review's results will provide practical recommendations concerning the effective nursing care for each daily care activity and overall daily care activities for managing resistance-to-care behaviors of older adults with dementia in nursing homes.Resistance-to-care behaviors are, in reality, often very difficult to differentiate from other dementia-related behaviors. For instance the term ""noncompliance"" was used in one study referring to ""resistiveness to care"", which preceded physically aggressive behavior occurring in response to the invasion of the resident's personal space. This clearly encapsulates the resistive nature of the behavior demonstrated by nursing home residents. Other terms possibly overlapping with the meaning of ""resistance-to-care"" behaviors include ""uncooperative behaviours"", ""disruptive behaviours"", ""aggression/aggressive behaviours"", ""combative behaviour"", or ""agitation/ agitated behaviours"". Again, these terms are largely used interchangeably and no clear cut difference appears to exist in the nursing literature. For this reason the review will include any papers that have used any of those definitions as long as the studies meet the inclusion criteria.A preliminary search of the JBI Library of systematic reviews, PubMed, CINAHL and the Cochrane library have shown there is no systematic review on the present topic.",2012,,JBI Libr Syst Rev,10,58,4622-4632,,10.11124/jbisrir-2012-431,27820527,#172,Konno 2012

Diabetes is also a risk factor for dementia, but whether the association is similar in women and men remains unknown. We performed a meta-analysis of unpublished data to estimate the sex-specific relationship between women and men with diabetes with incident dementia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic search identified studies published prior to November 2014 that had reported on the prospective association between diabetes and dementia. Study authors contributed unpublished sex-specific relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs on the association between diabetes and all dementia and its subtypes. Sex-specific RRs and the women-to-men ratio of RRs (RRRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Study-level data from 14 studies, 2,310,330 individuals, and 102,174 dementia case patients were included. In multiple-adjusted analyses, diabetes was associated with a 60% increased risk of any dementia in both sexes (women: pooled RR 1.62 [95% CI 1.45-1.80]; men: pooled RR 1.58 [95% CI 1.38-1.81]).

Pubmed,Current Practices in the Treatment of Alzheimer Disease: Where is the Evidence After the Phase III Trials?,Ehret MJ; Chamberlin KW,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to review the current place in therapy of the 4 medications, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine, approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) since the publication of Phase III trials. METHODS: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted for articles published in the past 10 years. The search was performed using the following Medical Subject Headings and text key words: Alzheimer's disease, treatment, donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, memantine, dementia of the Alzheimer's type, and dementia. FINDINGS: Studies that evaluated new doses, indications, and dose formulations remain a large part of the current literature. Donepezil gained approval for the treatment of severe AD and became available in a 23-mg/d dose formulation. Rivastigmine became available in a patch formulation. Memantine became available as an extended-release capsule. Use of a combination product formulation was recently approved, memantine extended release/donepezil. Controversy among clinicians remains regarding when to initiate therapy, appropriate duration of therapy, and how and when to discontinue the treatment of AD. IMPLICATIONS: Only drugs that affect cholinergic function have shown consistent, but modest, clinical effects, even in late-phase trials. There is a need for a better appreciation of the various risk factors and drug targets for the treatment of AD. The wide range of targets makes it unlikely that affecting only 1 of those targets (eg, cholinergic function or N-methyl-d-aspartate) will lead to a more than minimally effective treatment option, regardless of when a treatment is started and discontinued. There is substantial opportunity for the continued growth and development of drugs and clinical trial expansion for the treatment of AD.",2015,Aug,Clin Ther,37,8,1604-16,,10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.05.510,26122885,#160,Ehret 2015
Pubmed,Cost and cost-effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet: results of a systematic review.,Saulle R; Semyonov L; La Torre G,"The growing impact of chronic degenerative pathologies (such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease) requires and pushes towards the development of new preventive strategies to reduce the incidence and prevalence of these diseases. Lifestyle changes, especially related to the Mediterranean diet, have the potential to modify disease outcomes and ultimately costs related to their management. The objective of the study was to perform a systematic review of the scientific literature, to gauge the economic performance and the cost-effectiveness of the adherence to the Mediterranean diet as a prevention strategy against degenerative pathologies. We investigated the monetary costs of adopting Mediterranean dietary patterns by determining cost differences between low and high adherence. Research was conducted using the PubMed and Scopus databases. Eight articles met the pre-determined inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Quality assessment and data extraction was performed. The adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been extensively reported to be associated with a favorable health outcome and a better quality of life. The implementation of a Mediterranean dietary pattern may lead to the prevention of degenerative pathologies and to an improvement in life expectancy, a net gain in health and a reduction in total lifetime costs.",2013,Nov,Nutrients,5,11,4566-86,,10.3390/nu5114566,24253053,#159,Saulle 2013
Pubmed,"Education, Socioeconomic Status, and Intelligence in Childhood and Stroke Risk in Later Life: A Meta-analysis.",McHutchison CA; Backhouse EV; Cvoro V; Shenkin SD; Wardlaw JM,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is the second most common cause of death, and a common cause of dependency and dementia. Adult vascular risk factors and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with increased risk, but less is known about early life risk factors, such as education, childhood SES, or intelligence (IQ). METHODS: We comprehensively searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from inception to November 2015. We included all studies reporting data on >50 strokes examining childhood/premorbid IQ, SES, and education. Two reviewers independently screened full texts and extracted and cross-checked data, including available risk factor adjustments. We meta-analyzed stroke risk using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and mean differences (MD). We tested effects of study and participant characteristics in sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. RESULTS: We identified 90 studies examining stroke risk and education (79), SES (10), or IQ (nine) including approximately 164,683 stroke and over 5 million stroke-free participants. Stroke risk increased with lower education (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.48), SES (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.46), and IQ (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.37) in studies reporting point estimates, with similar associations for MD. We found minimal publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was partly explained by participant age and case ascertainment method. CONCLUSIONS: Education, childhood SES, and intelligence have modest but important associations with lifetime stroke, and hence dementia, risks. Future studies distinguishing between the individual and combined effects of education, childhood SES and intelligence are needed to determine the independent contribution of each factor to stroke risk.

The Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphism as a risk factor in vascular dementia has been suggested, but direct evidence from genetic association studies remains inconclusive even in Chinese population. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis in order to evaluate the relationship between ApoE gene polymorphism and susceptibility to vascular dementia in Chinese population by pooling data from all relevant case-control studies published domestically and abroad from January 1990 to May 2011. 18 case-control studies were selected. Meta-analysis results showed that the pooled OR value of vascular dementia subjects in Chinese population with Îµ4 allele carriers was 2.07 [95% CI (1.69, 2.53)], and the pooled OR value of vascular dementia subjects with E4/E4 genotype was 3.34 [95% CI (1.89, 5.88)].

Pubmed,Prevalence and patterns of cognitive impairment in acute coronary syndrome patients: A systematic review.,Zhao E; Lowres N; Woolaston A; Naismith SL; Gallagher R,"BACKGROUND: Minimising risk factors through secondary prevention behaviour is challenging for patients following an acute coronary syndrome. Cognitive impairment can potentially make these changes more difficult. However, cognitive impairment prevalence in acute coronary syndrome patients is poorly understood. DESIGN: This study was based on a systematic review. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases up to March 2019, to identify studies reporting the prevalence of cognitive impairment in acute coronary syndrome patients. Predefined inclusion criteria were specified, including use of a validated cognitive impairment screening tool. Studies were excluded if patients had diagnosed dementia or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Strengthening The Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Cochrane Risk of Bias tools were used to assess quality. RESULTS: From 747 potential studies, nine were included. The total sample size was 6457 (range 53-2174), mean age range was 51.3-77.4 years, and range of proportions of males was 57-100%. Reported cognitive impairment prevalence rates varied substantially (9-85%) with no clear pattern over time. From the two studies which examined domains, verbal fluency, memory and language were affected the most. Meta-analysis could not be undertaken due to diverse screening tools (nâ€‰=â€‰9), cut-off scores and screening timepoints. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in acute coronary syndrome patients is currently poorly described, and likely affects a substantial number of acute coronary syndrome patients who remain undetected and have the potential to develop to dementia in the future. As domains are most affected, this could impact understanding and retention of health education. Research is needed to accurately determine the prevalence of cognitive impairment in acute coronary syndrome patients and create suitable standardised measures and thresholds.",2020,Feb,Eur J Prev Cardiol,27,3,284-293,,10.1177/2047487319878945,31645116,#150,Zhao 2020
Pubmed,The Use of Motion-Based Technology for People Living With Dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Literature Review.,Dove E; Astell AJ,"BACKGROUND: The number of people living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is increasing substantially. Although there are many research efforts directed toward the prevention and treatment of dementia and MCI, it is also important to learn more about supporting people to live well with dementia or MCI through cognitive, physical, and leisure means. While past research suggests that technology can be used to support positive aging for people with dementia or MCI, the use of motion-based technology has not been thoroughly explored with this population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and synthesize the current literature involving the use of motion-based technology for people living with dementia or MCI by identifying themes while noting areas requiring further research. METHODS: A systematic review of studies involving the use of motion-based technology for human participants living with dementia or MCI was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 31 articles met the inclusion criteria. Five questions are addressed concerning (1) context of use; (2) population included (ie, dementia, MCI, or both); (3) hardware and software selection; (4) use of motion-based technology in a group or individual setting; and (5) details about the introduction, teaching, and support methods applied when using the motion-based technology with people living with dementia or MCI. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review confirm the potential of motion-based technology to improve the lives of people living with dementia or MCI. The use of this technology also spans across several contexts including cognitive, physical, and leisure; all of which support multidimensional well-being. The literature provides evidence that people living with dementia or MCI can learn how to use this technology and that they enjoy doing so. However, there is a lack of information provided in the literature regarding the introduction, training, and support methods applied when using this form of technology with this population. Future research should address the appropriate introduction, teaching, and support required for people living with dementia or MCI to use the motion-based technology. In addition, it is recommended that the diverse needs of these specific end-users be considered in the design and development of this technology.",2017,Jan,J Med Internet Res,19,1,e3,,10.2196/jmir.6518,28077346,#149,Dove 2017
Pubmed,The Elusive Nature of APOE Îµ4 in Mid-adulthood: Understanding the Cognitive Profile.,Lancaster C; Tabet N; Rusted J,"OBJECTIVES: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele is an established risk factor for dementia, yet this genetic variant is associated with a mixed cognitive profile across the lifespan. This study undertakes both a systematic and meta-analytic review of research investigating APOE-related differences in cognition in mid-adulthood, when detrimental effects of the allele may first be detectable. METHODS: Thirty-six papers investigating the behavioral effects of APOE Îµ4 in mid-adulthood (defined as a mean sample age between 35 and 60 years) were reviewed. In addition, the effect of carrying an Îµ4 allele on individual cognitive domains was assessed in separate meta-analyses. RESULTS: The average effect size of APOE Îµ4 status was non-significant across cognitive domains. Further consideration of genotype effects indicates preclinical effects of APOE Îµ4 may be observable in memory and executive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive profile of APOE Îµ4 carriers at mid-age remains elusive. Although there is support for comparable performance by Îµ4 and non-e4 carriers in the 5th decade, studies administering sensitive cognitive paradigms indicate a more nuanced profile of cognitive differences. Methodological issues in this field preclude strong conclusions, which future research must address, as well as considering the influence of further vulnerability factors on genotype effects.

Height may capture early-life illness, adversity, nutrition and psychosocial stress. AIMS: To investigate the little-explored association between height and dementia death. Method Individual participant meta-analysis using 18 prospective general population cohort studies with identical methodologies (1994-2008; n = 181 800). RESULTS: Mean follow-up of 9.8 years gave rise to 426 and 667 dementia deaths in men and women respectively. The mean heights were 174.4 cm (s.d. = 7.3) for men and 161.0 cm (s.d. = 6.8) for women. In analyses taking into account multiple covariates, increasing height was related to lower rates of death from dementia in a dose-response pattern (P â©_ 0.01 for trend). There was evidence of a differential effect by gender (P = 0.016 for interaction). Thus, the association observed in men (hazard ratio per s.d. decrease in height 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39) was markedly stronger than that apparent in women (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24).

Pubmed,Determinants of systemic hypertension in older adults in Africa: a systematic review.,Bosu WK; Aheto JMK; Zucchelli E; Reilly ST,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 55% of older adults in Africa have systemic hypertension, a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure and dementia in the region. The risk factors associated with hypertension in this population group in Africa have not been systematically evaluated. We, therefore, undertook a systematic review to identify these risk factors. METHODS: We searched for population-based studies of adults aged â‰¥50â€‰years living in Africa and reporting an estimate of hypertension and associated risk factors. We included articles published in any language between January 1980 and May 2018 using a comprehensive search strategy. We extracted data including the sample characteristics, prevalence of hypertension and risk factors with their effect sizes. RESULTS: From an initial 10,719 records, we retained 63 eligible full text articles for review out of which we analyzed 23 studies made up of 19 primary and four multiple publications which had data on risk factors from bivariate or multivariable analysis. The primary studies, published from 2010 to 2018, involved a total of 30,500 participants in 12 different countries with mean ages ranging from 62.7â€‰Â±â€‰9â€‰years to 76.9â€‰Â±â€‰8.4â€‰years. Through narrative synthesis, we found consistent determinants of hypertension (overweight/obesity and history of stroke), less consistent but frequent determinants (including older age group, female sex and urban residence), inconsistent determinants (including education, wealth index, alcohol intake and physical activity) and nonsignificant covariates (marital status and having health insurance). Overall, the highest adjusted odds ratios were those associated with obesity and history of stroke. CONCLUSION: The key determinants of systemic hypertension in older adults in Africa are older age group, overweight/obesity, history of stroke and female sex.

Pubmed,The influence of ApoE4 on clinical progression of dementia: a meta-analysis.,Allan CL; Ebmeier KP,"OBJECTIVE: ApoE4 is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease, and has a functional role suggesting its importance in the neuropathology of dementia. We present a meta-analysis to investigate whether ApoE4 also affects the clinical progression of dementia in terms of cognitive decline or mortality. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and PsychINFO from 1990 until April 2009, for case control or cohort studies which investigated the effect of ApoE4 on progression of dementia. We identified 427 studies; 17 were suitable for inclusion. In total, there were 1733 participants with dementia at baseline, of whom 975 were heterozygous or homozygous for ApoE4. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in cognitive decline (random-model effect sizeâ€‰=â€‰0.02; 95% C.-I.: -0.09 to 0.14; pâ€‰=â€‰0.67) or mortality (random-model pooled odds ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.74; 95% C.-I.: 0.36 to 1.53; pâ€‰=â€‰0.41) based on the presence of ApoE4. There was no significant heterogeneity between studies using cognitive decline as an outcome. In meta-regressions of cognitive decline, duration of symptoms, age, gender and frequency of participants with ApoE4 in the samples did not contribute to outcome.

Pubmed,Association of apolipoprotein E genetic variation in Alzheimer's disease in Indian population: a meta-analysis.,Agarwal R; Tripathi CB,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is an age-related disorder associated with elderly population, resulting from interaction of lifestyle risk factors with genetic, vascular, and other risk factors to affect risk of disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, estimated to be affecting 4.4% of the population older than 65 years of age. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) Îµ4 allele is a known genetic risk factor for AD, which not only predisposes and influences the severity of pathological changes in the brain, thereby modifying the age at onset, but also promotes cognitive decline early in nondemented older people. OBJECTIVES: To review the published evidence on ApoE polymorphism with the susceptibility to AD and frequency of ApoE Îµ4 genotype (Îµ4/-) and homozygotes (Îµ4/4) among patients diagnosed with AD as compared to controls in Indian Population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, MEDLINE was reviewed for articles published till June 2013 supplemented by citation analysis from retrieved articles to select case-control studies. A meta-analysis was performed to demonstrate the association of ApoE gene with vascular dementia by random effects to demonstrate models. The association was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, using clinical criteria for AD with ApoE polymorphism determined for allele and genotype in both cases and controls. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A meta-analysis was performed to demonstrate the association of ApoE gene with AD by random effects to demonstrate models. The association was assessed by OR with 95% CIs. We also looked for publication bias and performed sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of each individual study. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies representing data from 417 patients with AD and 651 controls in the Indian population were eligible. The ApoE Îµ2/4, Îµ3/4, and Îµ4/4 genotypes (OR = 3.93, 95% CI: 1.60-9.68; OR = 4.18, 95% CI: 2.54-6.87; OR = 4.81, 95% CI: 1.95-11.86, respectively) as well as ApoE Îµ4 allele (OR = 5.90, 95% CI: 3.44-10.13) were associated with an increased risk of AD, whereas ApoE Îµ2/3, Îµ3/3 genotypes (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.32-0.83; OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.19-0.42), and ApoE Îµ3 allele (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17-0.50) were found to be marginally significant protective factors for AD.

A better understanding of the dynamics of the association between gait speed and cognitive status may identify preclinical markers and improve diagnostic assessments. The objective was to quantify the association between gait speed and cognitive status in later life. METHODS: A systematic search was undertaken of relevant databases for original articles published prior to June 2017, measuring the association between gait speed and cognition cross-sectionally or longitudinally among the community-dwelling population. A meta-analysis pooled results of the mean difference between concurrent measures of gait speed in the normal cognition group compared to non-normal cognition groups. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were selected, providing data from 29,520 participants. The majority of studies reported a significant association between slower gait speed and worse cognitive function in older people. Results of the meta-analysis of 27 studies showed that, compared to normal controls, clinically meaningful reductions in gait speed ranged from 0.11 m/s in those with cognitive impairment, to 0.20 m/s in those with mild dementia, and to 0.41 m/s in those with moderate dementia. CONCLUSION: The strength of evidence for an association between gait speed and cognition was demonstrated by the number and consistency of results, as well as quality of the studies.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the neuroimaging profile of Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (VaMCI), the impact of those aspects over cognition and the neuropsychological tests that distinguished VaMCI from other groups. METHODS: Searches were performed in Scopus, ISI and PsycINFO, using the following key terms: ""vascular mild cognitive impairment"" OR ""vascular cognitive impairment no dementia"" OR ""vascular cognitive impairment not demented"" OR ""subcortical mild cognitive impairment"". RESULTS: Of 249 papers, 20 studies were selected. Ten of those included only patients with severe White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH), whereas 10 others admitted subjects with moderate-to-severe WMH.

Following PRISMA guidelines for a systematic review, the study examined peer-reviewed empirical research publications focused on leisure activity, cognitive decline, and prevention. METHODS: Searches in the PubMed/Medline reSEARCH, CINHAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsychoINFO, ERIC Proquest, the Cochrane library, and PsycARTICLES databases for the years 2000 to 2011 identified 52 publications for inclusion. RESULTS: The results are discussed and based on these findings are further interpreted using the Model of Human Occupation, which focuses on key factors identified in the review that are salient to associations between participation in leisure activities and prevention of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: While the findings support a growing consensus that participation in leisure activities might significantly contribute to prevention of dementia, it also identifies major hindrances to progress. Important limitations detected include a lack of theoretical underpinnings, and little consensus and standardisation in the measured key variables.

DESIGN: Three longitudinal, population-based cohort studies. SETTING: Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom; Leiden, the Netherlands; and Lakes and Bay of Plenty District Health Board areas, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Newcastle 85+ Study participants (n = 616), Leiden 85-plus Study participants (n = 444), and Life and Living in Advanced Age, a Cohort Study in New Zealand (LiLACS NZ Study) participants (n = 396). MEASUREMENTS: FSRP, CAIDE risk score, oxi-inflammatory load, FSRP incorporating oxi-inflammatory load, and CAIDE risk score incorporating oxi-inflammatory load. Oxi-inflammatory load could be calculated only in the Newcastle 85+ and the Leiden 85-plus studies. Measures of global cognitive function were available for all three data sets.

Both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions were considered. Inclusion criteria were sample size greater or equal to 50, at least 6 months of follow-up, and participants with no cognitive impairment at baseline. Outcomes included dementia incidence, cognitive decline and cognitive function. Study quality was rated using the Jadad criteria. Thirty-nine studies, 17 non-pharmacological and 22 pharmacological, were included. Results were heterogeneous across interventions and studies, with few significant effects. Studies investigating physical activity and calcium channel blocker treatment demonstrated significant effects in preventing cognitive decline. There were no conclusive results demonstrating overall capacity of assessed interventions to reduce risk of dementia. The review provides an overview of the current literature, and identifies areas in need of further research.",2015,,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,2,1,38-45,,10.14283/jpad.2015.36,29234774,#132,Barnett 2015
Pubmed,Role of traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,Gupta PP; Pandey RD; Jha D; Shrivastav V; Kumar S,"The role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been evaluated in many studies. We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on the relation between use of classical NSAIDs and AD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the role of classical NSAIDs in AD was searched using different search engines. The RCTs in patients who had the degree of AD measured on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) were included in the study. The RCTs and data (AD scores) were independently assessed by 2 reviewers, and data were included in meta-analysis only after a common consensus was reached. The pooled results from the ADAS-cog and MMSE scores failed to show any difference between the treatment and the placebo groups as opposed to findings from some observational studies.

Pubmed,"Conservative interventions for incontinence in people with dementia or cognitive impairment, living at home: a systematic review.",Drennan VM; Greenwood N; Cole L; Fader M; Grant R; Rait G; Iliffe S,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a distressing and disabling illness with worldwide estimates of increased numbers of people with the condition. Two thirds of people with dementia live at home and policies in many countries seek to support more people for longer in this setting. Incontinence both contributes to carer burden and is also a significant factor in the decision to move into care homes. A review was conducted for evidence of effectiveness for conservative interventions, which are non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions, for the prevention or management of incontinence in community dwelling people with dementia. METHOD: Fourteen electronic databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (from inception to 2012). Assessments of risk of bias were made. Meta-analysis was inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measurements. A narrative analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: From 427 identified abstracts, 56 studies were examined but only three met the inclusion criteria, all more than a decade old. All three focused on urinary incontinence. Two studies were exploratory or pilot studies. All had a control arm. The interventions were of advice for the carer to implement. Two included toileting education of prompted voiding or an individualised toileting schedule. There was insufficient evidence to support or rule out effectiveness of any of these interventions. Some interventions were unacceptable for some carers. None specifically reported the perspective of the person with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient evidence from any studies to recommend any strategies. There remains an urgent need for both research and also clinical guidance for health professionals tailored to community settings where the majority of people with dementia live.",2012,Dec,BMC Geriatr,12,,77,,10.1186/1471-2318-12-77,23272951,#130,Drennan 2012
Pubmed,Evidence for Structural and Functional Alterations of Frontal-Executive and Corticolimbic Circuits in Late-Life Depression and Relationship to Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia: A Systematic Review.,Rashidi-Ranjbar N; Miranda D; Butters MA; Mulsant BH; Voineskos AN,"Depression is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). We conducted a systematic review between 2008 and October 2018, to evaluate the evidence for a conceptual mechanistic model linking depression and ADRD, focusing on frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits. We focused on two neuroimaging modalities: diffusion-weighted imaging measuring white matter tract disruptions and resting-state functional MRI measuring alterations in network dynamics in late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and LLD+MCI vs. healthy control (HC) individuals. Our data synthesis revealed that in some but not all studies, impairment of both frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits, as well as impairment of global brain topology was present in LLD, MCI, and LLD+MCI vs. HC groups. Further, posterior midline regions (posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus) appeared to have the most structural and functional alterations in all patient groups. Future cohort and longitudinal studies are required to address the heterogeneity of findings, and to clarify which subgroups of people with LLD are at highest risk for developing MCI and ADRD.",2020,,Front Neurosci,14,,253,,10.3389/fnins.2020.00253,32362808,#128,Rashidi-Ranjbar 2020

In this investigation, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the purported associations. Subgroup analyses based on ethnicity (Caucasians, East-Asian and American mixed) were also performed including a total of 5,676 AD patients and 5,460 controls for ACT-17. Overall, allele contrast (A vs. T) of ACT -17 polymorphism produced significant results in the worldwide population [P(heterogeneity)=0.01, random-effects (RE) odds ratio (OR) 1.12; 95% CI 1.04-1.21, P=0.003] and in the Caucasian population [P(heterogeneity)=0.03, RE OR1.11 95% CI 1.01-1.24, P=0.04]. Meta-analyses of other genetic contrasts suggested that the A allele carriers are associated with increased susceptibility to AD in variant populations. No significant association was observed in the East-Asian subgroup analysis. In conclusion, ACT-17 variation presents a risk factor for AD in the worldwide population, especially in the Caucasian population.",2013,Jan,Curr Alzheimer Res,10,1,63-71,,,22272609,#127,Dou 2013
Pubmed,Current Developments in Dementia Risk Prediction Modelling: An Updated Systematic Review.,Tang EY; Harrison SL; Errington L; Gordon MF; Visser PJ; Novak G; Dufouil C; Brayne C; Robinson L; Launer LJ; Stephan BC,"BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of individuals at high risk of dementia influences clinical care, inclusion criteria for clinical trials and development of preventative strategies. Numerous models have been developed for predicting dementia. To evaluate these models we undertook a systematic review in 2010 and updated this in 2014 due to the increase in research published in this area. Here we include a critique of the variables selected for inclusion and an assessment of model prognostic performance. METHODS: Our previous systematic review was updated with a search from January 2009 to March 2014 in electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science). Articles examining risk of dementia in non-demented individuals and including measures of sensitivity, specificity or the area under the curve (AUC) or c-statistic were included. FINDINGS: In total, 1,234 articles were identified from the search; 21 articles met inclusion criteria. New developments in dementia risk prediction include the testing of non-APOE genes, use of non-traditional dementia risk factors, incorporation of diet, physical function and ethnicity, and model development in specific subgroups of the population including individuals with diabetes and those with different educational levels. Four models have been externally validated. Three studies considered time or cost implications of computing the model. INTERPRETATION: There is no one model that is recommended for dementia risk prediction in population-based settings. Further, it is unlikely that one model will fit all. Consideration of the optimal features of new models should focus on methodology (setting/sample, model development and testing in a replication cohort) and the acceptability and cost of attaining the risk variables included in the prediction score. Further work is required to validate existing models or develop new ones in different populations as well as determine the ethical implications of dementia risk prediction, before applying the particular models in population or clinical settings.",2015,,PLoS One,10,9,e0136181,,10.1371/journal.pone.0136181,26334524,#121,Tang 2015
Pubmed,Exploring Structural and Functional Brain Changes in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Whole Brain ALE Meta-Analysis for Multimodal MRI.,Gu L; Zhang Z,"BACKGROUND: Unraveling novel biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was highlighted in the prevention and modification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inconsistent results for comparison between MCI patients and healthy controls (HC) were obtained from previous neuroimaging studies. METHODS: An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was made for multimodal neuroimaging in MCI. After initial research and step-by-step exclusions procedures, n = 101 articles (MCI, n = 2681; HC, n = 2941, respectively) were included in the study. RESULTS: It detected MCI related gray matter atrophy in the bilateral medial temporal lobe and white matter abnormality in the left posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, caudate, and bilateral precuneus. It revealed MCI-related decreased resting-state activity in the left superior temporal gyrus, right posterior cingulate/precuneus, and uncus and hyperactivation in the inferior parietal lobule and superior parietal lobule compared to HC. Task-related functional neuroimaging studies indicated MCI-related hypoactivation in the left inferior parietal lobule, right posterior cingulate, and bilateral precuneus and hyperactivation in the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, insula, superior temporal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Via this ALE meta-analysis, we obtained these key regions suffering from different kinds of deficits in MCI. These regional abnormalities in MRI studies might serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis of MCI.",2019,Jun,ACS Chem Neurosci,10,6,2823-2829,,10.1021/acschemneuro.9b00045,30808171,#119,Gu 2019
Pubmed,Prevalence of psychiatric disorders among older adults in long-term care homes: a systematic review.,Seitz D; Purandare N; Conn D,"BACKGROUND: The population of older adults in long-term care (LTC) is expected to increase considerably in the near future. An understanding of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in LTC will help in planning mental health services for this population. This study reviews the prevalence of common psychiatric disorders in LTC populations. METHODS: We searched electronic databases for studies on the prevalence of major psychiatric disorders in LTC using medical subject headings and key words. We only included studies using validated measures for diagnosing psychiatric disorders or psychiatric symptoms. Our review focused on the following psychiatric disorders: dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), major depression, depressive symptoms, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and alcohol use disorders. We also determined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the U.S. LTC population using data from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). RESULTS: A total of 74 studies examining the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychological symptoms in LTC populations were identified including 30 studies on the prevalence of dementia, 9 studies on behavioral symptoms in dementia, and 26 studies on depression. Most studies involved few LTC facilities and were conducted in developed countries. Dementia had a median prevalence (58%) in studies while the prevalence of BPSD was 78% among individuals with dementia. The median prevalence of major depressive disorder was 10% while the median prevalence of depressive symptoms was 29% among LTC residents. There were few studies on other psychiatric disorders. Results from the 2004 NNHS were consistent with those in the published literature. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia, depression and anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among older adults in LTC. Many psychiatric disorders appear to be more prevalent in LTC settings when compared to those observed in community-dwelling older adults. Policy-makers and clinicians should be aware of the common psychiatric disorders in LTC and further research into effective prevention and treatments are required for this growing population.",2010,Nov,Int Psychogeriatr,22,7,1025-39,,10.1017/S1041610210000608,20522279,#118,Seitz 2010
Pubmed,Physical Activity and Î_-Amyloid Brain Levels in Humans: A Systematic Review.,de Souto Barreto P; Andrieu S; Rolland Y,"Physical activity (PA) contributes to brain health and plasticity, which suggests that PA would protect against the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, research on PA and AD biomarkers is very scarce. The objective of the present study was to perform a systematic review of studies that investigated the associations between PA and Î_-amyloid brain deposition in humans. Electronic searches were performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, SportDiscus, PEDro, and PsychInfo databases. Articles were eligible if they have assessed both PA and Î_-amyloid brain deposition in humans. Five articles, published between 2010 and 2013, met eligibility criteria (study population varied across studies from 54 to 515, according with the Î_-amyloid measure. All five studies assessed both PA and PET-amyloid; among them, two studies also assessed CSF AÎ_42 levels). All studies were based on cross-sectional data, from non-demented populations. Among the five included studies, three found significant associations between PA and Î_-amyloid brain deposition, and the other two did not find any significant association; limited evidence suggests that PA-amyloid plaques associations would be APOE Îµ4 allele-specific. In sum, no solid conclusions can be drawn on the associations between PA and human Î_-amyloid brain deposition currently. Future research on this topic should particularly pay attention to the operationalisation of clinically relevant and valid PA variables and should include important confounders in multivariate analysis. More information is needed on the potential interactions between PA and other AD risk factors (e.g., cognitive activities, APOE Îµ4 status, nutrition, smoking) and their combined effects on AD biomarkers.",2015,,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,2,1,56-63,,10.14283/jpad.2015.34,29234777,#117,deSoutoBarreto 2015
Pubmed,Epidemiology of neurodegenerative diseases in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.,Lekoubou A; Echouffo-Tcheugui JB; Kengne AP,"BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are experiencing rapid transitions with increased life expectancy. As a result the burden of age-related conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases might be increasing. We conducted a systematic review of published studies on common neurodegenerative diseases, and HIV-related neurocognitive impairment in SSA, in order to identify research gaps and inform prevention and control solutions. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, 'Banque de DonnÃ©es de SantÃ© Publique' and the database of the 'Institut d'Epidemiologie Neurologique et de Neurologie Tropicale' from inception to February 2013 for published original studies from SSA on neurodegenerative diseases and HIV-related neurocognitive impairment. Screening and data extraction were conducted by two investigators. Bibliographies and citations of eligible studies were investigated. RESULTS: In all 144 publications reporting on dementia (n = 49 publications, mainly Alzheimer disease), Parkinsonism (PD, n = 20), HIV-related neurocognitive impairment (n = 47), Huntington disease (HD, n = 19), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 15), cerebellar degeneration (n = 4) and Lewy body dementia (n = 1). Of these studies, largely based on prevalent cases from retrospective data on urban populations, half originated from Nigeria and South Africa. The prevalence of dementia (Alzheimer disease) varied between <1% and 10.1% (0.7% and 5.6%) in population-based studies and from <1% to 47.8% in hospital-based studies. Incidence of dementia (Alzheimer disease) ranged from 8.7 to 21.8/1000/year (9.5 to 11.1), and major risk factors were advanced age and female sex. HIV-related neurocognitive impairment's prevalence (all from hospital-based studies) ranged from <1% to 80%. Population-based prevalence of PD and ALS varied from 10 to 235/100,000, and from 5 to 15/100,000 respectively while that for Huntington disease was 3.5/100,000. Equivalent figures for hospital based studies were the following: PD (0.41 to 7.2%), ALS (0.2 to 8.0/1000), and HD (0.2/100,000 to 46.0/100,000). CONCLUSIONS: The body of literature on neurodegenerative disorders in SSA is large with regard to dementia and HIV-related neurocognitive disorders but limited for other neurodegenerative disorders. Shortcomings include few population-based studies, heterogeneous diagnostic criteria and uneven representation of countries on the continent. There are important knowledge gaps that need urgent action, in order to prepare the sub-continent for the anticipated local surge in neurodegenerative diseases.",2014,Jun,BMC Public Health,14,,653,,10.1186/1471-2458-14-653,24969686,#115,Lekoubou 2014

The present evidence mapping summarizes recent evidence for the efficacy of occupational therapy with older persons based on randomised controlled trials from 2004-2012. METHOD: An electronic search in Cochrane and Medline databases identified publications of randomised controlled trials on occupational therapy interventions for personsâ‰¥65 years old. Two raters independently extracted data and analysed the quality of samples, interventions and outcome evalutations according to PRISMA criteria. RESULTS: In all, 136 abstracts were identified and 48 studies analysed, from these 12 on stroke, 15 on falls and mobility, 7 on dementia, 4 on prevention and 10 on other conditions. Reports of adverse events and evaluations of costs and long-term outcomes are frequently lacking.

Pubmed,Personality and Cognitive Decline in Older Adults: Data From a Longitudinal Sample and Meta-Analysis.,Luchetti M; Terracciano A; Stephan Y; Sutin AR,"OBJECTIVES: Personality traits are associated with risk of dementia; less is known about their association with the trajectory of cognitive functioning. This research examines the association between the 5 major dimensions of personality and cognitive function and decline in older adulthood and includes a meta-analysis of published studies. METHOD: Personality traits, objective and subjective memory, and cognitive status were collected in a large national sample (N = 13,987) with a 4-year follow-up period. For each trait, the meta-analysis pooled results from up to 5 prospective studies to examine personality and change in global cognition. RESULTS: Higher Neuroticism was associated with worse performance on all cognitive measures and greater decline in memory, whereas higher Conscientiousness and Openness were associated with better memory performance concurrently and less decline over time. All traits were associated with subjective memory. Higher Conscientiousness and lower Extraversion were associated with better cognitive status and less decline. Although modest, these associations were generally larger than that of hypertension, diabetes, history of psychological treatment, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. The meta-analysis supported the association between Neuroticism and Conscientiousness and cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Personality is associated with cognitive decline in older adults, with effects comparable to established clinical and lifestyle risk factors.",2016,Jul,J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,71,4,591-601,,10.1093/geronb/gbu184,25583598,#112,Luchetti 2016
Pubmed,Prevalence of minor depression in elderly persons with and without mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,Polyakova M; Sonnabend N; Sander C; Mergl R; Schroeter ML; Schroeder J; SchÃ¶nknecht P,"BACKGROUND: Minor depression (MinD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are common disorders in late life that often coexist. The aim of the present review is to demonstrate prevalence rates of minor depression in older patients with and without MCI. METHODS: Electronic database searches were performed through Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Psycinfo, and Cochrane library. Two independent reviewers extracted the original studies based on inclusion criteria: representative study population aged 55 and older, diagnostics of MinD according to DSM. Data on prevalence rates, risk factors, comorbidity and health care usage were analyzed. RESULTS: Point prevalence for MinD is higher in medical settings (median 14.4%) than in the community-based settings (median 10.4%) and primary care patients (median 7.7%). Although minor depression is rarely investigated in elderly persons with MCI, nearly 20% of patients with MCI seem to suffer from MinD. No data was found on the prevalence of MCI in patients with MinD. Risk factors associated with MinD include female gender, history of cerebrovascular diseases, generalized anxiety disorder, loneliness, and long-term institutional care. LIMITATIONS: Methodological differences of included studies resulted in a broad range of prevalence rates. No data is shown regarding the prevalence of MCI in MinD group due to insufficient evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our review indicates that MinD is frequent in elderly population. MCI among those subjects has not been sufficiently investigated. Future studies based on clinical structured interviews should be performed in longitudinal design in order to differentiate late-life depression from progressive MCI or early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease.",2014,Jan,J Affect Disord,152-154,,28-38,,10.1016/j.jad.2013.09.016,24103852,#111,Polyakova 2014
Pubmed,Depressive Symptoms in the Elderly-An Early Symptom of Dementia? A Systematic Review.,Wiels W; Baeken C; Engelborghs S,"BACKGROUND: Depression and dementia are common incapacitating diseases in old age. The exact nature of the relationship between these conditions remains unclear, and multiple explanations have been suggested: depressive symptoms may be a risk factor for, a prodromal symptom of, or a coincidental finding in dementia. They may even be unrelated or only connected through common risk factors. Multiple studies so far have provided conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a systematic literature review can clarify the nature of the relation between depressive symptoms and dementia. METHODS: Using the Patient/Problem/Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome or PICO paradigm, a known framework for framing healthcare and evidence questions, we formulated the question ""whether depressive symptoms in cognitively intact older adults are associated with a diagnosis of dementia later in life."" We performed a systematic literature review of MEDLINE and PsycINFO in November 2018, looking for prospective cohort studies examining the aforementioned question. RESULTS: We critically analyzed and listed 31 relevant papers out of 1,656 and grouped them according to the main hypothesis they support: depressive symptoms as a risk factor, not a risk factor, a prodromal symptom, both, or some specific other hypothesis. All but three studies used clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia alone (i.e., no biomarkers or autopsy confirmation). Several studies contain solid arguments for the hypotheses they support, yet they do not formally contradict other findings or suggested explanations and are heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: The exact nature of the relationship between depressive symptoms and dementia in the elderly remains inconclusive, with multiple studies supporting both the risk factor and prodromal hypotheses. Some provide arguments for common risk factors. It seems unlikely that there is no connection at all. We conclude that at least in a significant part of the patients, depressive symptoms and dementia are related. This may be due to common risk factors and/or depressive symptoms being a prodromal symptom of dementia and/or depression being a risk factor for dementia. These causal associations possibly overlap in some patients. Further research is warranted to develop predictive biomarkers and to develop interventions that may attenuate the risk of ""conversion"" from depressive symptoms to dementia in the elderly.",2020,,Front Pharmacol,11,,34,,10.3389/fphar.2020.00034,32116710,#110,Wiels 2020

To understand this increased incidence, they performed a systematic review of the literature on neuroanatomical differences between veterans with chronic CR-PTSD and control subjects (22 included studies). The hippocampus was most commonly and consistently reported to differ between groups, thereby suggesting the hypothesis that PTSD is associated with smaller hippocampi, which increases the risk for dementia. However, an alternate hypothesis is that smaller hippocampal volumes are a preexisting risk factor for PTSD and dementia. Studies are clearly needed to differentiate between these important possibilities.",2013,Winter,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,25,1,25-Dec,,10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12010003,23487189,#109,Childress 2013
Pubmed,Association between metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline: a systematic review of prospective population-based studies.,Hao Z; Wu B; Wang D; Liu M,"OBJECTIVE: The association between metabolic syndrome (MS) and the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia remains unclear. In this article, we systematically review studies on the risk of cognitive disorders in patients with MS to determine the strength of the association between MS and cognitive decline. METHODS: Electronic databases through December 2009 were searched to identify prospective population-based studies that examined the association between MS and risk of cognitive disorders. Two reviewers used a standardised form to collect data and assess eligibility. The quality of study was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: We found nine eligible studies that involve 19 876 participants. All studies but two indicate that MS is associated with cognitive decline (from one-fold to more than two-fold increase in risk). It seems that MS may be associated with cognitive impairment (positive results in three of five) and vascular dementia (positive results in two of three), whereas three studies involving patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) did not find the association between MS and AD. When examining the association of the individual risk factors of the MS and cognition in seven eligible studies, glucose (three studies) and hypertension (three studies) showed positive results associated with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: The MS may be associated with cognitive impairment and vascular dementia but not for AD, which need to be further investigated with high-quality studies.",2011,Apr,Acta Neuropsychiatr,23,2,69-74,,10.1111/j.1601-5215.2011.00527.x,26952861,#108,Hao 2011
Pubmed,Effectiveness of interventions for the assessment and prevention of falls in adult psychiatric patients: A systematic review.,Xu C; Audrey TX; Shi SL; Shanel YW; Tan JM; Premarani K; Parasuram R; Kumar SV,"BACKGROUND: Patient fall is among the top five sentinel events in hospitals due to the resultant functional loss and injury sustained. Precise fall risk assessment and prevention strategies are important components of a fall prevention program. Due to psychiatric conditions and medications, these patients may require a different fall management program compared to other patient populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to identify the best available evidence for the effectiveness of nursing fall risk assessment tools, interventions to reduce incidence of falls, and common risk factors of adult psychiatric patients who fall. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adults (19 to 64 years) diagnosed with mental illnessEvaluation of nursing fall risk assessment tools in adult psychiatric settings, and interventions, which minimised fall risk or fall rates.Number of patient falls during hospitalisation was the main outcome.Primary quantitative studies published in English language. SEARCH STRATEGY: The literature search sought published studies, and was limited to English language reports. There were no date restrictions applied to the search. Electronic databases searched included:CINAHLPubMedCochrane Central Register of Controlled TrialsPsycINFOScienceDirectScopusWeb of ScienceWiley-InterScienceProQuestMedNar METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies retrieved were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information (JBI-SUMARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Data including specific details about the methods, settings, purposes, populations, interventions, and outcomes significant to the review's objectives were extracted by two independent reviewers using standardised data extraction tools from JBI-SUMARI. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in this review: three before-and-after studies, four descriptive studies, two case control studies and two cohort studies. Evidence with regards to the effectiveness of fall risk assessment tools and prevention strategies was inconclusive. Certain risk factors which were more frequently associated with falls included diagnoses of depression, bipolar disorder, and dementia / Alzheimer's disease, altered mental status, physiological symptoms, past history of falls, mobility and gait problems, concurrent medical conditions, polypharmacy, and taking of certain medications such as sedatives, antidepressants and mood stabilisers, particularly lithium. CONCLUSION: Evidence on the effectiveness of fall risk assessment tools and prevention strategies in psychiatric setting was inconclusive due to a paucity of studies. However, certain risk factors were found to be more commonly associated with falls in adult psychiatric patients (Level III Evidence).Constant observation of the side effects of medications, particularly orthostatic hypotension, and review of patients' medical profile by doctors or pharmacists may be helpful in preventing falls in psychiatric patients. Findings on common risk factors can better aid healthcare professionals in identifying psychiatric patients who are at risk for falls.More research is needed on the evaluation of fall risk assessment tools and fall prevention strategies, specifically for the adult psychiatric patients. More prospective and better quality studies examining fall risk factors in psychiatric patients are needed.",2012,,JBI Libr Syst Rev,10,9,513-573,,10.11124/01938924-201210090-00001,27820546,#105,Xu 2012
Pubmed,Education and dementia in the context of the cognitive reserve hypothesis: a systematic review with meta-analyses and qualitative analyses.,Meng X; D'Arcy C,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR) or brain reserve capacity explains why individuals with higher IQ, education, or occupational attainment have lower risks of developing dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD). The CR hypothesis postulates that CR reduces the prevalence and incidence of AD or VaD. It also hypothesizes that among those who have greater initial cognitive reserve (in contrast to those with less reserve) greater brain pathology occurs before the clinical symptoms of disease becomes manifest. Thus clinical disease onset triggers a faster decline in cognition and function, and increased mortality among those with initial greater cognitive reserve. Disease progression follows distinctly separate pathological and clinical paths. With education as a proxy we use meta-analyses and qualitative analyses to review the evidence for the CR hypothesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, PsycoINFO, EMBASE, HealthStar, and Scopus databases from January 1980 to June 2011 for observational studies with clear criteria for dementia, AD or VaD and education. One hundred and thirty-three articles with a variety of study designs met the inclusion criteria. Prevalence and incidence studies with odds ratios (ORs), relative risks or original data were included in the meta-analyses. Other studies were reviewed qualitatively. The studies covered 437,477 subjects. Prevalence and incidence studies with pooled ORs of 2.61 (95%CI 2.21-3.07) and 1.88 (95%CI 1.51-2.34) respectively, showed low education increased the risk of dementia. Heterogeneity and sensitivity tests confirmed the evidence. Generally, study characteristics had no effect on conclusions. Qualitative analyses also showed the protective effects of higher education on developing dementia and with clinical disease onset hastening a decline in cognition and function, and greater brain pathology. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This systematic review and meta-analyses covering a wide range of observational studies and diverse settings provides robust support for the CR hypothesis. The CR hypothesis suggests several avenues for dementia prevention.",2012,,PLoS One,7,6,e38268,,10.1371/journal.pone.0038268,22675535,#102,Meng 2012
Pubmed,"Age-related cognitive decline and associations with sex, education and apolipoprotein E genotype across ethnocultural groups and geographic regions: a collaborative cohort study.",Lipnicki DM; Crawford JD; Dutta R; Thalamuthu A; Kochan NA; Andrews G; Lima-Costa MF; Castro-Costa E; Brayne C; Matthews FE; Stephan BC; Lipton RB; Katz MJ; Ritchie K; Scali J; Ancelin ML; Scarmeas N; Yannakoulia M; Dardiotis E; Lam LC; Wong CH; Fung AW; Guaita A; Vaccaro R; Davin A; Kim KW; Han JW; Kim TH; Anstey KJ; Cherbuin N; Butterworth P; Scazufca M; Kumagai S; Chen S; Narazaki K; Ng TP; Gao Q; Reppermund S; Brodaty H; Lobo A; Lopez-Anton R; SantabÃ¡rbara J; Sachdev PS,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia varies around the world, potentially contributed to by international differences in rates of age-related cognitive decline. Our primary goal was to investigate how rates of age-related decline in cognitive test performance varied among international cohort studies of cognitive aging. We also determined the extent to which sex, educational attainment, and apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele (APOE*4) carrier status were associated with decline. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We harmonized longitudinal data for 14 cohorts from 12 countries (Australia, Brazil, France, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States), for a total of 42,170 individuals aged 54-105 y (42% male), including 3.3% with dementia at baseline. The studies began between 1989 and 2011, with all but three ongoing, and each had 2-16 assessment waves (median = 3) and a follow-up duration of 2-15 y. We analyzed standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and memory, processing speed, language, and executive functioning test scores using linear mixed models, adjusted for sex and education, and meta-analytic techniques. Performance on all cognitive measures declined with age, with the most rapid rate of change pooled across cohorts a moderate -0.26 standard deviations per decade (SD/decade) (95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.35, -0.16], p < 0.001) for processing speed. Rates of decline accelerated slightly with age, with executive functioning showing the largest additional rate of decline with every further decade of age (-0.07 SD/decade, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.03], p = 0.002). There was a considerable degree of heterogeneity in the associations across cohorts, including a slightly faster decline (p = 0.021) on the MMSE for Asians (-0.20 SD/decade, 95% CI [-0.28, -0.12], p < 0.001) than for whites (-0.09 SD/decade, 95% CI [-0.16, -0.02], p = 0.009). Males declined on the MMSE at a slightly slower rate than females (difference = 0.023 SD/decade, 95% CI [0.011, 0.035], p < 0.001), and every additional year of education was associated with a rate of decline slightly slower for the MMSE (0.004 SD/decade less, 95% CI [0.002, 0.006], p = 0.001), but slightly faster for language (-0.007 SD/decade more, 95% CI [-0.011, -0.003], p = 0.001). APOE*4 carriers declined slightly more rapidly than non-carriers on most cognitive measures, with processing speed showing the greatest difference (-0.08 SD/decade, 95% CI [-0.15, -0.01], p = 0.019). The same overall pattern of results was found when analyses were repeated with baseline dementia cases excluded. We used only one test to represent cognitive domains, and though a prototypical one, we nevertheless urge caution in generalizing the results to domains rather than viewing them as test-specific associations. This study lacked cohorts from Africa, India, and mainland China. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive performance declined with age, and more rapidly with increasing age, across samples from diverse ethnocultural groups and geographical regions. Associations varied across cohorts, suggesting that different rates of cognitive decline might contribute to the global variation in dementia prevalence. However, the many similarities and consistent associations with education and APOE genotype indicate a need to explore how international differences in associations with other risk factors such as genetics, cardiovascular health, and lifestyle are involved. Future studies should attempt to use multiple tests for each cognitive domain and feature populations from ethnocultural groups and geographical regions for which we lacked data.",2017,Mar,PLoS Med,14,3,e1002261,,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002261,28323832,#101,Lipnicki 2017
Pubmed,A Systematic Review Examining Associations between Cardiovascular Conditions and Driving Outcomes among Older Drivers.,Babulal GM; Kolady R; Stout SH; Roe CM,"There is a vast literature on stroke as a cardiovascular disease and driving outcomes, however little is known about other cardiovascular conditions and driving. The purpose of this review is to examine the literature for studies assessing the effect of non-stroke, vascular conditions on daily driving, reported crash risk and driving decline in older adult drivers as captured by naturalistic methodologies. A systematic review of Embase, Ovid and Scopus Plus examined articles on driving and vascular conditions among older adults. A search yielded 443 articles and, following two screenings, no articles remained that focused on non-stroke, vascular conditions and naturalistic driving. As a result, this review examined non-stroke, vascular conditions in nine driving studies of older adults that used road testing, driving simulators and self-report measures. These studies fell into three categories-heart failure, vascular dementia and white matter hyperintensities/leukoaraiosis. The combined findings of the studies suggest that heart failure, vascular dementia and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) negatively impact driving performance and contribute to driving cessation among older adults. Future research should examine cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, myocardial infraction or atherosclerosis using naturalistic driving measurement, as well as traditional measures, in order to more fully characterize how these conditions impact older adult driving.",2020,Apr,Geriatrics (Basel),5,2,,,10.3390/geriatrics5020027,32353970,#98,Babulal 2020
Pubmed,Does cognitive impairment impact adherence? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence in stroke.,Rohde D; Merriman NA; Doyle F; Bennett K; Williams D; Hickey A,"BACKGROUND: While medication adherence is essential for the secondary prevention of stroke, it is often sub-optimal, and can be compromised by cognitive impairment. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse the association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence in stroke. METHODS: A systematic literature search of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of adults with any stroke type, which reported on the association between any measure of non-adherence and cognitive impairment, was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were the primary measure of effect. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Bias Methods Group's Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies, with evidence quality assessed according to the GRADE approach. We conducted sensitivity analyses according to measure of cognitive impairment, measure of medication adherence, population, risk of bias and adjustment for covariates. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO. RESULTS: From 1,760 titles and abstracts, we identified 9 studies for inclusion. Measures of cognitive impairment varied from dementia diagnosis to standardised cognitive assessments. Medication adherence was assessed through self-report or administrative databases. The majority of studies were of medium risk of bias (n = 6); two studies had low risk of bias. Findings were mixed; when all studies were pooled, there was no evidence of an association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence post-stroke [OR (95% CI): 0.85 (0.66, 1.03)]. However, heterogeneity was substantial [I2 = 90.9%, p < .001], and the overall evidence quality was low. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have explored associations between cognitive impairment and medication adherence post-stroke, with substantial heterogeneity in study populations, and definitions and assessments of non-adherence and cognitive impairment. Further research using clear, standardised and objective assessments is needed to clarify the association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence in stroke.",2017,,PLoS One,12,12,e0189339,,10.1371/journal.pone.0189339,29220386,#97,Rohde 2017
Pubmed,The Trajectory of Caregiver Burden and Risk Factors in Dementia Progression: A Systematic Review.,van den Kieboom RCP; Snaphaan LJAE; Mark RE; Bongers IMB,"BACKGROUND: Caring for patients with dementia at home is often a long-term process, in which the independence of the patient declines, and more responsibility and supervision time is required from the informal caregiver. OBJECTIVE: In order to minimize and reduce caregiver burden, it is important to explore its trajectory and the accompanying risk factors as dementia progresses; the objective of this systematic review. METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were followed in this systematic review. Three databases, PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMbase, were systematically searched in November 2019 using specific keywords. RESULTS: 1,506 hits emerged during the systematic search but only eleven articles actually met the inclusion criteria for this review. The trajectory of caregiver burden is highly variable and depends on multiple factors. Important risk factors included: patients' behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and their decline in functioning in (I)ADL; the caregiver's age, gender, and physical and mental health; and, within the dyads (patient/caregiver), cohabitation and kinship. CONCLUSION: There is no one-size-fits-all for predicting how caregiver burden will change over time, but specific factors (like being a spouse and increased behavioral impairment and decline in functional status in the patient) may heighten the risk. Other factors, not yet comprehensively included in the published studies, might also prove to be important risk factors. Future research in the field of reducing caregiver burden is recommended to integrate the patient, caregiver, and context characteristics in the trajectory of caregiver burden, and to assess more clearly the phase of the dementia progression and use of external resources.",2020,Aug,J Alzheimers Dis,,,,,10.3233/JAD-200647,32804093,#96,vandenKieboomRCP 2020
Pubmed,Volunteer programs supporting people with dementia/delirium in hospital: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,Pritchard E; Soh SE; Morello R; Berkovic D; Blair A; Anderson K; Bateman C; Moran C; Tsindos T; O'Donnell R; Ayton D,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Volunteer delivered programs to assist people with dementia and/or delirium in-hospital, can provide person-centred one-on-one support additional to usual care. These programs could mitigate hospital resource demands, however, their effectiveness is unknown. This review evaluated literature of volunteer programs in acute hospital settings for people living with dementia and/or delirium. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four databases were searched. Studies that reported patient or program outcomes were included (i.e. delirium incidence, length-of-stay, number of falls, satisfaction). Risk of bias was completed. Meta-analysis was performed where two or more studies measured the same outcome. Narrative synthesis was performed on the qualitative results. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the review, with varied design, participant groups and outcomes measured. Risk of bias averaged 71%. Volunteer delivered programs addressed delirium risk factors e.g. hydration/nutrition, mobility, use of sensory aids. Eight patient and six program outcomes were captured but only three patient outcomes could be pooled. Meta-analyses demonstrated a reduction in delirium incidence (rate ratio=0.65; 95% CI 0.47, 0.90) but no reduction in length-of-stay (mean difference -1.09; 95% CI -0.58, 2.77) or number of falls (rate ratio=0.67; 95%CI 0.19, 2.35). Narrative synthesis identified benefits to patients (e.g. less loneliness), volunteers (sense of meaning), and staff (timesaving, safety). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Volunteer delivered programs for inpatients with dementia and/or delirium may provide benefits for patients, volunteers and staff. However, studies conducted with more robust designs are required to determine overall effectiveness on program outcomes. Further high-quality research appropriate for this vulnerable population is required to identify volunteer program effectiveness.",2020,May,Gerontologist,,,,,10.1093/geront/gnaa058,32462186,#95,Pritchard 2020
Pubmed,Silent Cerebral Infarction in East Asian vs. Non-Asian Atrial Fibrillation Patientsã€€- Meta-Analysis.,Senoo K; Kondo Y; Kobayashi Y; Lip GY,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the ageing population in East Asia. Silent cerebral infarction (SCI) is defined as cerebral infarction in the absence of corresponding clinical symptoms, and is a highly prevalent and morbid condition in AF. SCI is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for future stroke, which can lead to cognitive decline or dementia. The latter is an increasingly common health problem in East Asia.Methodsâ€„andâ€„Results:We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the association of AF and SCI between East Asian and non-Asian patients. AF was associated with SCI in patients with no symptomatic stroke history (relative risk [RR], 2.24; 95% CI: 1.26-3.99, I(2)=83%; P=0.006) although the prevalence varied widely between studies (P for heterogeneity<0.001). In non-Asian patients, the prevalence of SCI in AF is higher than that in controls (RR, 1.85; 95% CI: 1.65-2.08, I(2)=17%; P<0.001). There was no significant racial difference between Asian and non-Asian studies (P=0.53). CONCLUSIONS: In East Asia, AF was significantly associated with SCI and no racial difference was seen between East Asian and non-Asian patients. The present findings offer clinicians new insights into the association between AF and SCI.",2018,Feb,Circ J,82,3,672-676,,10.1253/circj.CJ-17-1164,29279460,#94,Senoo 2018
Pubmed,Metaanalysis of risk factors for mortality in patients with hip fracture.,Norring-Agerskov D; Laulund AS; Lauritzen JB; Duus BR; van der Mark S; Mosfeldt M; JÃ¸rgensen HL,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the association of three different clinical score systems with the mortality in hip fracture patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on November 13, 2011 using PubMed and Embase. The search yielded 315 publications which were reviewed on the basis of the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included for further processing. The following clinical score systems were found to be of prognostic value for mortality in hip fracture patients: a high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of three or above (odds ratio (OR): 3.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.78-3.38; p < 0.00001, 15,625 study participants included), a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of one or more (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.79-2.34; p < 0.00001, 13,570 study participants included) and dementia (assessed with Mini Mental State Examination or obtained from journal extraction) (OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.64-4.57; p = 0.0001; 1,782 study participants included). CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis showed that the ASA score, the CCI score and assessment of preexisting dementia are useful in predicting the mortality of hip fracture patients.",2013,Aug,Dan Med J,60,8,A4675,,,23905564,#90,Norring-Agerskov 2013

We report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) with HS-Aging pathology as an endophenotype. In collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, data were analyzed from large autopsy cohorts: (#1) National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC); (#2) Rush University Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; (#3) Group Health Research Institute Adult Changes in Thought study; (#4) University of California at Irvine 90+ Study; and (#5) University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center. Altogether, 363 HS-Aging cases and 2,303 controls, all pathologically confirmed, provided statistical power to test for risk alleles with large effect size. A two-tier study design included GWAS from cohorts #1-3 (Stage I) to identify promising SNP candidates, followed by focused evaluation of particular SNPs in cohorts #4-5 (Stage II). Polymorphism in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9 (ABCC9) gene, also known as sulfonylurea receptor 2, was associated with HS-Aging pathology. In the meta-analyzed Stage I GWAS, ABCC9 polymorphisms yielded the lowest p values, and factoring in the Stage II results, the meta-analyzed risk SNP (rs704178:G) attained genome-wide statistical significance (pÂ =Â 1.4Â Ã—Â 10(-9)), with odds ratio (OR) of 2.13 (recessive mode of inheritance). For SNPs previously linked to hippocampal sclerosis, meta-analyses of Stage I results show ORÂ =Â 1.16 for rs5848 (GRN) and ORÂ =Â 1.22 rs1990622 (TMEM106B), with the risk alleles as previously described. Sulfonylureas, a widely prescribed drug class used to treat diabetes, also modify human ABCC9 protein function. A subsample of patients from the NACC database (nÂ =Â 624) were identified who were older than age 85 at death with known drug history. Controlling for important confounders such as diabetes itself, exposure to a sulfonylurea drug was associated with risk for HS-Aging pathology (pÂ =Â 0.03). Thus, we describe a novel and targetable dementia risk factor.",2014,,Acta Neuropathol,127,6,825-43,,10.1007/s00401-014-1282-2,24770881,#89,Nelson 2014
Pubmed,Association Between Traumatic Brain Injury and Dementia in Veterans: A Rapid Systematic Review.,Peterson K; Veazie S; Bourne D; Anderson J,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the prevalence of dementia in Veterans versus civilians and the association between previous traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and the risk and timing of dementia onset in Veterans. DESIGN: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to October 2018. One reviewer assessed articles for inclusion, evaluated study quality, graded strength of evidence, and extracted data, with second reviewer checking. RESULTS: Forty articles were included, among which 10 presented the best evidence. Evidence suggests that dementia rates are likely similar between Veterans and civilians (10.7% vs 8.8%-11.6%, respectively). Dementia prevalence is likely higher in those with TBI (6%-16%) than in those without (3%-10%), with a possible dose-response relationship between the two. There may also be an association between TBI and early-onset dementia, although this evidence has important limitations. No studies evaluated whether dementia prevalence varied on the basis of combat deployment history or era of conflict. CONCLUSION: Dementia prevalence is likely similar in Veteran and civilian populations, and the risk of dementia is likely increased by TBI. To inform development of screening, prevention, and rehabilitation efforts, research is still needed addressing the mechanism of association and timing of dementia onset.

Pubmed,The Relationship of Coronary Artery Calcium and Clinical Coronary Artery Disease with Cognitive Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Xia C; Vonder M; Sidorenkov G; Oudkerk M; de Groot JC; van der Harst P; de Bock GH; De Deyn PP; Vliegenthart R,"AIM: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and cognitive impairment are common in the elderly, with evidence for shared risk factors and pathophysiological processes. The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is a marker of subclinical CAD, which may allow early detection of individuals prone to cognitive decline. Prior studies on associations of CAC and clinical CAD with cognitive impairment had discrepant results. This systematic review aims to evaluate the association of (sub)clinical CAD with cognitive function, cognitive decline, and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science until February 2019, supplemented with citations tracking. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted information including odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Forty-six studies, 10 on CAC and 36 on clinical CAD, comprising 1,248,908 participants were included in the systematic review. Studies about associations of (sub)clinical CAD with cognitive function and cognitive decline had heterogeneous methodology and inconsistent findings. Two population-based studies investigated the association between CAC and risk of dementia over 6-12.2 years using different CAC scoring methods. Both found a tendency toward higher risk of dementia as CAC severity increased. Meta-analysis in 15 studies (663,250 individuals) showed an association between CAD and MCI/dementia (pooled OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.17-1.48) with substantial heterogeneity (I(2)=87.0%, pï_œ0.001). Pooled HR of CAD for incident MCI/dementia over 3.2-25.5 years in six longitudinal studies (70,060 individuals) was 1.51 (95%CI 1.24-1.85), with low heterogeneity (I(2)=14.1%, p=0.32). Sensitivity analysis did not detect any study that was of particular influence on the pooled OR or HR. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence suggests the CAC score is associated with risk of dementia. In clinical CAD, risk of MCI and dementia is increased by 50%, as supported by stronger evidence.",2020,Sep,J Atheroscler Thromb,27,9,934-958,,10.5551/jat.52928,32062643,#87,Xia 2020
Pubmed,APOE Îµ4 and cognitive function in early life: a meta-analysis.,Ihle A; Bunce D; Kliegel M,"INTRODUCTION: It is well established that the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele is associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in old age. By contrast, several studies have demonstrated cognitive benefits in young Îµ4 carriers. It is therefore possible that the Îµ4 allele exhibits a pleiotropic association with cognition across the life span where Îµ4-related benefits in youth reverse to become risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia in later life. To date, though, there has been no broad quantitative review of work assessing APOE-cognition associations in children, adolescents and young adults. METHOD: Based on 20 studies investigating cognitive performance in Îµ4-carrying young persons and their non-Îµ4 counterparts, a meta-analytic study was conducted to examine APOE Îµ4-related differences in cognitive performance. Additionally, we assessed whether the level of executive demands affected the strength of associations between the Îµ4 allele and cognitive measures. RESULTS: In all analyses, estimated APOE Îµ4-related population effect sizes did not reliably differ from zero. Furthermore, the level of executive demands of the task did not affect this finding. CONCLUSION: We found no APOE Îµ4-related cognitive benefits in young adults, adolescents and children, and findings were not moderated by the level of executive demands in a cognitive task. Given the current empirical evidence therefore, suggestions that APOE Îµ4 exhibits a pleiotropic association with cognition across the life span should be treated with caution.",2012,May,Neuropsychology,26,3,267-77,,10.1037/a0026769,22329498,#86,Ihle 2012
Pubmed,Vitamin B-Can it prevent cognitive decline? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Behrens A; Graessel E; Pendergrass A; Donath C,"BACKGROUND: Development of cognitive decline represents substantial issues in today's society, steadily gaining importance with increasing life expectancy. One potential approach to preventing cognitive decline is to lower homocysteine by administering vitamin B. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we address this topic and investigate whether oral supplementation of vitamin B can successfully prevent cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals. METHODS: A computerized systematic literature search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Eligibility criteria included oral supplementation with vitamin B (B(1), B(6), folic acid, and B(12)) and the absence of cognitive impairment. A meta-analysis was conducted with ""global cognition"" as the primary outcome of this review. Secondary outcomes were changes in cognitive function in other cognitive domains reported in the included studies. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the GRADE approach to establish the overall certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: The meta-analysis did not yield a significant overall effect of supplementation with vitamin B on cognitive function (Z = 0.87; p = 0.39; SMD, 0.02; 95% CI, -â€‰0.034, 0.08). A sensitivity analysis focusing on specific risk factors did not alter this result. Some studies reported isolated significant effects of the intervention on secondary outcomes. However, these findings were outnumbered by the number of cognitive tests that did not yield significant effects. DISCUSSION: We found no overall evidence that oral vitamin B supplementation prevented cognitive decline. The isolated significant effects that were reported could be attributed to methodological issues. The results of this review do not provide evidence that population groups with certain risk factors would profit more from the intervention than others. Our findings do not apply to forms of administration other than oral supplementation nor do they offer information regarding the treatment of cognitively impaired individuals via the administration of vitamin B.

Pubmed,Public knowledge of the influence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors on dementia: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,Parial LL; Lam SC; Ho JYS; Suen LKP; Leung AYM,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examined whether the general public are aware of the influence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) on dementia. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, five electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Scopus) were searched for studies published from 2009-2019, using the key terms ""knowledge,"" ""modifiable cardiovascular risk factors,"" and ""dementia."" Standardized critical appraisal instruments were used to evaluate the quality of the studies. RESULTS: Of the 1,533 articles that were screened, 26 were included in this review. Modifiable CVRFs of dementia included behavioral factors (physical inactivity, poor dietary practices, high alcohol consumption, and heavy smoking) and medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity). Although the association between CVRFs and dementia was identified (pooled prevalence is 24-50%), overall knowledge about this relationship in the general public was low. Sociodemographic variables, such as higher education, better economic status, and prior contact with a person with dementia, positively influenced dementia risk knowledge. Ethnic minorities showed good awareness of dementia risk from cardiovascular-related conditions. CONCLUSION: Despite dementia is considered as a public health priority by World Health Organization, knowledge of the modifiable CVRFs and dementia is low in the general population. Public health policymakers should develop appropriate educational programs and interventions to equip the communities and vulnerable groups with this understanding so that they can be prepared to reduce dementia risk.",2020,Jul,Aging Ment Health,,,15-Jan,,10.1080/13607863.2020.1786801,32633131,#82,Parial 2020
Pubmed,Prevalence and correlates for sleep complaints in older adults in low and middle income countries: a 10/66 Dementia Research Group study.,Mazzotti DR; Guindalini C; Sosa AL; Ferri CP; Tufik S,"BACKGROUND: Although it is well recognized that the prevalence of sleep complaints increases with age, estimates in developing countries are still unknown. The present study aims to estimate the prevalence and prevalence ratios of the correlates of sleep complaints in a large population of older adults from low and middle income countries (LAMICs). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed in 16,680 65 year-old or older residents in catchment areas of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, China, India, and Puerto Rico (10/66 Dementia Research Group study). Information about socio-demographic factors, lifestyle, health, and sleep complaints was obtained. Results were standardized by age, sex, household clustering, and residence site (urban or rural). Prevalence ratios were derived for each country and fixed effects meta-analyses were used to combine them. RESULTS: The standardized prevalence of sleep complaints varied from 9.1% (China) to 37.7% (India). The meta-analysis showed that female gender, urban residence, low educational level, low physical activity status, high pain scores, poor health, higher memory impairment score, presence of major depression, mild cognitive impairment, and high number of co-morbidities were associated with sleep complaints. CONCLUSIONS: This study robustly characterized the prevalence of sleep complaints in large samples of the elderly in LAMICs and identified potential risk factors that may be specific to these populations.

RESULTS: Of 3534 subjects, more than one-third (nâ€‰=â€‰1230, 35.2%) have a history of cardiovascular disease. Overall, 63% of subjects have two or more cardiovascular risk factors amenable to treatment. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is â‰¥160â€‰mmHg in 37% of patients with CVD, of which 28% is untreated. In subjects without a history of CVD, 41% have a SBPâ€‰â‰¥â€‰160â€‰mmHg of which 52% is untreated. A 5-15â€‰mmHg decrease in SBP is projected to prevent 12-32% of coronary heart disease and 16-41% of strokes, respectively. This corresponds with 14-38 prevented cases within 2 years in our intervention group (nâ€‰=â€‰1895). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors are very common in elderly subjects. Current (primary and secondary) prevention programmes appear insufficient. Improved antihypertensive treatment has the potential to prevent a substantial proportion of strokes and coronary heart disease in this population.",2012,Dec,Eur J Prev Cardiol,19,6,1365-72,,10.1177/1741826711422979,21930719,#74,Ligthart 2012
Pubmed,Post-traumatic stress disorder as a risk factor for dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis.,GÃ_nak MM; Billings J; Carratu E; Marchant NL; Favarato G; Orgeta V,"BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been identified as a potential risk factor for developing dementia. There are currently, however, no meta-analyses quantifying this risk. AIMS: To systematically review and quantify the risk of future dementia associated with PTSD across populations. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019130392. METHOD: We searched nine electronic databases up to 25 October 2019 for longitudinal studies assessing PTSD and risk of dementia. We used random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool estimates across studies. RESULTS: PTSD was associated with a significant risk for all-cause dementia: pooled hazard ratio HR = 1.61 (95% CI 1.43-1.81, I2= 85.8%, P < 0.001; n = 1 693 678; 8 studies). Pooled HR was 1.61 (95% CI 1.46-1.78; I2= 80.9%, P < 0.001; n = 905 896; 5 studies) in veterans, and 2.11 (95% CI 1.03-4.33, I2= 91.2%, P < 0.001; n = 787 782; 3 studies) in the general population. The association between PTSD and dementia remained significant after excluding studies with high risk of bias (HR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.39-1.73, I2= 83.9%, P < 0.001; n = 1 684 928; 7 studies). Most studies included were retrospective and there was evidence of high heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first meta-analysis quantifying the association of PTSD and risk of dementia showing that PTSD is a strong and potentially modifiable risk factor for all-cause dementia. Future studies investigating potential causal mechanisms, and the protective value of treating PTSD are needed.",2020,Sep,Br J Psychiatry,,,9-Jan,,10.1192/bjp.2020.150,32933591,#73,GÃ_nak 2020
Pubmed,Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Papadopoulos A; Palaiopanos K; Protogerou AP; Paraskevas GP; Tsivgoulis G; Georgakis MK,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with the risk of stroke and dementia independently of other vascular risk factors, but its association with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) remains unknown. Here, we employed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this gap. METHODS: Following the MOOSE guidelines (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42018110305), we systematically searched the literature for studies exploring the association between LVH or left ventricular (LV) mass, with neuroimaging markers of CSVD (lacunes, white matter hyperintensities [WMHs], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs]). We evaluated risk of bias and pooled association estimates with random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: We identified 31 studies (n=25,562) meeting our eligibility criteria. In meta-analysis, LVH was associated with lacunes and extensive WMHs in studies of the general population (odds ratio [OR]lacunes, 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 2.00) (ORWMH, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.17) and studies in highrisk populations (ORlacunes: 2.39; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.32) (ORWMH, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.45 to 2.80). The. RESULTS: remained stable in general population studies adjusting for hypertension and other vascular risk factors, as well as in sub-analyses by LVH assessment method (echocardiography/electrocardiogram), study design (cross-sectional/cohort), and study quality. Across LV morphology patterns, we found gradually increasing ORs for concentric remodelling, eccentric hypertrophy, and concentric hypertrophy, as compared to normal LV geometry. LVH was further associated with CMBs in high-risk population studies. CONCLUSION: s LVH is associated with neuroimaging markers of CSVD independently of hypertension and other vascular risk factors. Our findings suggest LVH as a novel risk factor for CSVD and highlight the link between subclinical heart and brain damage.",2020,May,J Stroke,22,2,206-224,,10.5853/jos.2019.03335,32635685,#72,Papadopoulos 2020
Pubmed,Ethical and Social Implications of Using Predictive Modeling for Alzheimer's Disease Prevention: A Systematic Literature Review.,Angehrn Z; Sostar J; Nordon C; Turner A; Gove D; Karcher H; Keenan A; Mittelstadt B; de Reydet-de Vulpillieres F,"BACKGROUND: The therapeutic paradigm in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is shifting from symptoms management toward prevention goals. Secondary prevention requires the identification of individuals without clinical symptoms, yet ""at-risk"" of developing AD dementia in the future, and thus, the use of predictive modeling. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the ethical concerns and social implications generated by this new approach. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review in Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Scopus, and complemented it with a gray literature search between March and July 2018. Then we analyzed data qualitatively using a thematic analysis technique. RESULTS: We identified thirty-one ethical issues and social concerns corresponding to eight ethical principles: (i) respect for autonomy, (ii) beneficence, (iii) non-maleficence, (iv) equality, justice, and diversity, (v) identity and stigma, (vi) privacy, (vii) accountability, transparency, and professionalism, and (viii) uncertainty avoidance. Much of the literature sees the discovery of disease-modifying treatment as a necessary and sufficient condition to justify AD risk assessment, overlooking future challenges in providing equitable access to it, establishing long-term treatment outcomes and social consequences of this approach, e.g., medicalization. The ethical/social issues associated specifically with predictive models, such as the adequate predictive power and reliability, infrastructural requirements, data privacy, potential for personalized medicine in AD, and limiting access to future AD treatment based on risk stratification, were covered scarcely. CONCLUSION: The ethical discussion needs to advance to reflect recent scientific developments and guide clinical practice now and in the future, so that necessary safeguards are implemented for large-scale AD secondary prevention.",2020,,J Alzheimers Dis,76,3,923-940,,10.3233/JAD-191159,32597799,#70,Angehrn 2020
Pubmed,A systematic literature review on nurses' and health care support workers' experiences of caring for people with dementia on orthopaedic wards.,Moonga J; Likupe G,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To review literature on nurses' and health care workers' experiences of caring for people with dementia on orthopaedic wards. BACKGROUND: Dementia is a condition that affects a large number of the older population worldwide. It is estimated that there are 47Â·5 million people worldwide living with dementia with 4Â·6 million new cases being diagnosed annually. This number is said to increase to 75Â·6 million by 2030 and triple by 2050. It is also acknowledged that older people are at a greater risk of falls that are a devastating problem causing a tremendous amount of morbidity, mortality and use of health care services (Rubestein, Age and Ageing, 35, 2006, 37). Falls usually result from identified risk factors such as weakness, unsteady gait, confusion and certain medication. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a large population of older people suffering from dementia may be admitted to orthopaedic wards with various injuries. Nurse and support health workers may experience a range of difficulties when caring for this population of patients. DESIGN: A systematic review. METHODS: An extensive literature search using; CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, National Health Service Evidence, websites like Department of Health, Dementia and Alzheimer's Society. RESULTS: The search generated several articles on dementia in general, however, only 14 articles dealing with care of these people in an acute hospital setting were found. No studies dealing with the care of people with dementia on orthopaedic wards were found; therefore, this review has taken a generalist nature and applies the findings to orthopaedic wards. The main themes identified from the review were: challenging behaviour and unsuitable care environment; lack of education on dementia; strain from nursing patients with dementia; and ethical dilemmas arising from care of people with dementia. CONCLUSION: It would be an over-simplification to say that the care of people with dementia on medical wards is the same as the care of trauma patients with dementia. Therefore, there is a need for a study to explore nurses' and health care worker's experiences of caring for trauma patients with dementia on orthopaedic wards. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results of this study could provide guidance on the effective care of people with dementia on orthopaedic wards.",2016,Jul,J Clin Nurs,25,13-14,1789-804,,10.1111/jocn.13158,26991944,#66,Moonga 2016

Using meta-analysis, we correlated blood pressure to multiple cognitive domains among older adults free of clinical stroke and dementia. We identified 230 studies indexed in PubMed and PsycINFO relating blood pressure and cognition. After applying exclusion criteria, we selected n = 12 articles with n = 4,076 participants (age range 43-91 years). Meta-analysis yielded an association between blood pressure and episodic memory (r = -.18, p < .001) and between blood pressure and global cognition (r = -.07, p < .001). When limiting analyses to studies adjusting for vascular covariates (n = 8, n = 2,141), blood pressure was modestly related to global cognition (r = -.11, p < .001), attention (r = .14, p = .002), and episodic memory (r = -.20, p < .001) with a trend for language (r = -.22, p = .07).

Pubmed,Predictive value of APOE-Îµ4 allele for progression from MCI to AD-type dementia: a meta-analysis.,Elias-Sonnenschein LS; Viechtbauer W; Ramakers IH; Verhey FR; Visser PJ,"BACKGROUND: The identification of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for prognosis and early intervention. The APOE-Îµ4 allele is the strongest known genetic risk factor for AD. The authors performed a meta-analysis to establish the predictive accuracy of the APOE-Îµ4 allele for progression from MCI to AD-type dementia. METHODS: The authors included 35 prospective cohort studies of subjects with MCI, including 6095 subjects, of whom 1236 progressed to AD-type dementia after 2.9 years of follow-up. Pooled estimates of the OR, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were obtained using random-effects models. RESULTS: The OR for subjects with MCI who are carriers of APOE-Îµ4 allele to progress to AD-type dementia was 2.29 (95% CI 1.88 to 2.80), the sensitivity was 0.53 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.61), the specificity was 0.67 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.71), the PPV was 0.57 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.66), the NPV was 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.80), the LR+ was 1.60 (95% CI 1.48 to 1.72), and the LR- was 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.82). Meta-regression showed that sensitivity, specificity and NPV were dependent on age, APOE-Îµ4 allele background prevalence or follow-up length. CONCLUSIONS: The APOE-Îµ4 allele is associated with a moderately increased risk for progression from MCI to AD-type dementia. The low sensitivity and PPV makes genotyping of limited value for predicting AD-type dementia in clinical practice. For trials aiming to prevent progression from MCI to AD-type dementia, APOE genotyping may be useful in selecting subjects with a higher risk for progression to AD-type dementia.",2011,Oct,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,82,10,1149-56,,10.1136/jnnp.2010.231555,21493755,#64,Elias-Sonnenschein 2011
Pubmed,Efficacy of physical exercise in preventing falls in older adults with cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Chan WC; Yeung JW; Wong CS; Lam LC; Chung KF; Luk JK; Lee JS; Law AC,"OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have reported the prevention of falls through exercise among cognitively healthy older people. This study aimed to determine whether the current evidence supports that physical exercise is also efficacious in preventing falls in older adults with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO; the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; the Cochrane Bone, Joint, and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio up to July 2013 without language restriction. We included randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of physical exercise in older adults with cognitive impairment. The methodological qualities of the included trials were appraised according to the criteria developed for the Cochrane review of fall prevention trials. The primary outcome measure was the rate ratio of falls. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled rate ratio and summarize the results of the trials on fall prevention through physical exercise. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials involving 781 participants were included, 4 of which examined solely older people with cognitive impairment. Subgroup data on persons with cognitive impairment were obtained from the other 3 trials that targeted older populations in general. The meta-analysis showed that physical exercise had a significant effect in preventing falls in older adults with cognitive impairment, with a pooled estimate of rate ratio of 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis suggests that physical exercise has a positive effect on preventing falls in older adults with cognitive impairment. Further studies will be required to determine the modality and frequency of exercise that are optimal for the prevention of falls in this population.",2015,Feb,J Am Med Dir Assoc,16,2,149-54,,10.1016/j.jamda.2014.08.007,25304179,#62,Chan 2015
Pubmed,Prevention of Delirium in Older Adults With Dementia: A Systematic Literature Review.,Schnitker L; NoviÄ‡ A; Arendts G; Carpenter CR; LoGiudice D; Caplan GA; Fick DM; Beattie E,"Although dementia is the largest independent risk factor for delirium and leads to poor health outcomes, we know little about how to prevent delirium in persons with dementia (PWD). The purpose of the current systematic literature review was to identify interventions designed to prevent delirium in older PWD. Seven studies meeting inclusion criteria were extracted. Five studies were in the acute care setting and two were community settings. One study used a randomized controlled trial design. Five of the seven interventions comprised multiple components addressing delirium risk factors, including education. Two studies addressed delirium by administration of medication or vitamin supplementation. Using the GRADE framework for the evaluation of study quality, we scored three studies as moderate and four studies as low. Thus, high-quality research studies to guide how best to prevent delirium in PWD are lacking. Although more research is required, the current review suggests that multicomponent approaches addressing delirium risk factors should be considered by health care professionals when supporting older PWD.

Pubmed,"Link Between Dietary Sodium Intake, Cognitive Function, and Dementia Risk in Middle-Aged and Older Adults: A Systematic Review.",Mohan D; Yap KH; Reidpath D; Soh YC; McGrattan A; Stephan BCM; Robinson L; Chaiyakunapruk N; Siervo M,"BACKGROUND: A key focus for dementia risk-reduction is the prevention of socio-demographic, lifestyle, and nutritional risk factors. High sodium intake is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (both are linked to dementia), generating numerous recommendations for salt reduction to improve cardiovascular health. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to assess, in middle- and older-aged people, the relationship between dietary sodium intake and cognitive outcomes including cognitive function, risk of cognitive decline, or dementia. METHODS: Six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Psych info, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) were searched from inception to 1 March 2020. Data extraction included information on study design, population characteristics, sodium reduction strategy (trials) or assessment of dietary sodium intake (observational studies), measurement of cognitive function or dementia, and summary of main results. Risk-of-bias assessments were performed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) assessment tool. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria including one clinical trial, six cohorts, and eight cross-sectional studies. Studies reported mixed associations between sodium levels and cognition. Results from the only clinical trial showed that a lower sodium intake was associated with improved cognition over six months. In analysis restricted to only high-quality studies, three out of four studies found that higher sodium intake was associated with impaired cognitive function. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that high salt intake is associated with poor cognition. However, findings are mixed, likely due to poor methodological quality, and heterogeneous dietary, analytical, and cognitive assessment methods and design of the studies. Reduced sodium intake may be a potential target for intervention. High quality prospective studies and clinical trials are needed.",2020,,J Alzheimers Dis,76,4,1347-1373,,10.3233/JAD-191339,32675410,#57,Mohan 2020
Pubmed,Advances in Non-Pharmacological Interventions for Subjective Cognitive Decline: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Sheng C; Yang K; Wang X; Li H; Li T; Lin L; Liu Y; Yang Q; Sun Y; Han Y,"BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the earliest symptomatic manifestation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, given the lack of effective and curable pharmacological treatments for AD, non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) for individuals with SCD may provide a valuable opportunity for the secondary prevention of AD. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, aimed to investigate the benefits of current NPIs in the population with SCD. METHODS: The online electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL, were searched to identify randomized controlled trials of NPIs for SCD. Intervention strategies were psychological and health-related education interventions, mind-body therapy, lifestyle modification, cognitive training, and multidomain interventions. Outcomes included subjective memory, objective memory, global cognitive function, psychological well-being, and mood. Study quality was determined using the criteria of the Cochrane collaboration's tool. The Hedges' g of change was analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in this review and meta-analysis. Overall, psychological and health-related education interventions exhibited a medium effect on objective memory function (Hedges' gâ€_=â€_0.53, pâ€_=â€_0.01). Cognitive training led to a small effect on objective memory, which was marginal statistically (Hedges' gâ€_=â€_0.19, pâ€_=â€_0.05). In addition, cognitive training also significantly improved subjective memory performance (Hedges' gâ€_=â€_0.49, pâ€_=â€_0.0003) and psychological well-being (Hedges' gâ€_=â€_0.27, pâ€_=â€_0.03).

Pubmed,Preventing falls among older people with mental health problems: a systematic review.,Bunn F; Dickinson A; Simpson C; Narayanan V; Humphrey D; Griffiths C; Martin W; Victor C,"BACKGROUND: Falls are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in older people and the risk of falling is exacerbated by mental health conditions. Existing reviews have focused on people with dementia and cognitive impairment, but not those with other mental health conditions or in mental health settings. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions for older people with mental health problems being cared for across all settings. METHODS: A systematic review of fall prevention interventions for older people with mental health conditions. We undertook electronic database and lateral searches to identify studies reporting data on falls or fall related injuries. Searches were initially conducted in February 2011 and updated in November 2012 and October 2013; no date restrictions were applied. Studies were assessed for risk of bias. Due to heterogeneity results were not pooled but are reported narratively. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs and four uncontrolled studies met the inclusion criteria; 11 involved single interventions and ten multifactorial. Evidence relating to fall reduction was inconsistent. Eight of 14 studies found a reduction in fallers (statistically significant in five), and nine of 14 reported a significant reduction in rate or number of falls. Four studies found a non-significant increase in falls. Multifactorial, multi-disciplinary interventions and those involving exercise, medication review and increasing staff awareness appear to reduce the risk of falls but evidence is mixed and study quality varied. Changes to the environment such as increased supervision or sensory stimulation to reduce agitation may be promising for people with dementia but further evaluation is needed. Most of the studies were undertaken in nursing and residential homes, and none in mental health hospital settings. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of falls research in mental health settings or which focus on patients with mental health problems despite the high number of falls experienced by this population group. This review highlights the lack of robust evidence to support practitioners to implement practices that prevent people with mental health problems from falling.",2014,Feb,BMC Nurs,13,1,4,,10.1186/1472-6955-13-4,24552165,#52,Bunn 2014
Pubmed,Association of Vitamin D Levels with Incident All-Cause Dementia in Longitudinal Observational Studies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Kalra A; Teixeira AL; Diniz BS,"BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D is not only limited to bone health and pathogenesis of chronic diseases. Evidence now suggests that it is also involved in the development of various dementias and Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and increased risk of incident all-cause dementia in longitudinal studies. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using the electronic bibliographic databases PubMed and Scopus. SETTING: Prospective cohort studies. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults. MEASUREMENTS: Vitamin D serum concentrations were categorized in three groups: normal levels (>50 nmol/L), insufficient levels (25 - 49.9 nmol/L), and deficient levels (<25 nmol/L). We performed a meta-analysis using the general inverse variance method to calculate the pooled risk of AD and all-cause dementia according to vitamin D levels. Random-effects or fixed-effect model were used to calculate the pooled risk based on the heterogeneity analysis. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled risk of all-cause dementia and AD was significantly higher in those with deficient serum vitamin D level compared to those with normal level (1.33, CI95% [1.15, 1.54], and 1.87, CI95% [1.03, 3.41], respectively). Those with insufficient level also had a higher pooled risk of all-cause dementia and AD, but the strength of association was less robust (1.14 CI95% [1.02, 1.27] and 1.25, CI95% [1.04 - 1.51], respectively). CONCLUSION: We found a gradient effect for the risk of all-cause dementia and AD according to the vitamin D level, with higher risk in those in the deficient levels group and intermediate risk in those with insufficient levels. Our findings were limited by the relatively small number of studies included in the meta-analysis and their geographic restriction.",2020,,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,7,1,14-20,,10.14283/jpad.2019.44,32010921,#51,Kalra 2020

METHODS: Potentially eligible publications were those providing effect estimates of relative risk (RR) for the association between Mediterranean diet and the aforementioned outcomes. Studies were sought in PubMed up to October 31, 2012. Maximally adjusted effect estimates were extracted; separate analyses were performed for high and moderate adherence. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible studies were included (11 covered stroke, 9 covered depression, and 8 covered cognitive impairment; only 1 pertained to Parkinson's disease). High adherence to Mediterranean diet was consistently associated with reduced risk for stroke (RR = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57-0.89), depression (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54-0.86), and cognitive impairment (RR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.43-0.83). Moderate adherence was similarly associated with reduced risk for depression and cognitive impairment, whereas the protective trend concerning stroke was only marginal. Subgroup analyses highlighted the protective actions of high adherence in terms of reduced risk for ischemic stroke, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and particularly Alzheimer disease. Meta-regression analysis indicated that the protective effects of Mediterranean diet in stroke prevention seemed more sizeable among males. Concerning depression, the protective effects of high adherence seemed independent of age, whereas the favorable actions of moderate adherence seemed to fade away with more advanced age. INTERPRETATION: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet may contribute to the prevention of a series of brain diseases; this may be of special value given the aging of Western societies.",2013,Oct,Ann Neurol,74,4,580-91,,10.1002/ana.23944,23720230,#47,Psaltopoulou 2013
Pubmed,Sarcopenia Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Cabett Cipolli G; Sanches Yassuda M; Aprahamian I,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is little evidence in the literature about the possible relationship between sarcopenia and cognition in older adults. Our objective was to investigate the association between cognitive impairment and sarcopenia in older adults living in the community through a systematic review of published studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis through Pubmed, LILACS, Scielo and Web of Science databases between March 1, 2001 and December 18, 2018. We included longitudinal and cross-sectional studies that evaluated sarcopenia and cognition as a primary objective. RESULTS: Of the 274 studies identified by the systematic review, 10 were included in qualitative analysis (total of 9,703 participants), and 6 were eligible for the meta-analysis (n = 7,045). Mean prevalence of sarcopenia was 10.5%. Cognitive impairment was observed in 269 participants with sarcopenia (40%), compared with 1,616 in non-sarcopenic participants (25.3%). Sarcopenia was significantly associated with cognitive impairment (pooled OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.26-4.92; p = 0.008). Heterogeneity across the studies was high and significant (IÂ_ = 84%). Discussion and Implications: Our analyzes confirmed that sarcopenic older adults presented a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment.

Pubmed,The association of renin-angiotensin system blockade use with the risks of cognitive impairment of aging and Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis.,Zhuang S; Wang HF; Wang X; Li J; Xing CM,"A quantitative meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association of renin-angiotensin system blockade (RASB) use with the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to October 2015. Ten studies that assessed the relationship between RASB use and the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging or AD were included. When randomized trials and observational studies were combined, the use of RASB was significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.92) and cognitive impairment of aging (RR, 0.65; 95% CI 0.35-0.94) compared no use of RASB. Meanwhile, in an analysis of subgroups, both subjects with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use were lower incidence of AD (RR, 0.87; 95% CI 0.74-1.00; RR, 0.69; 95% CI 0.44-0.93, respectively) than those without, whereas, indirect comparison between ACEI and ARB revealed no significance in the risk of AD (RR, 1.27, 95% CI 0.85-1.89, p=0.245). In an analysis of cognitive impairment of aging, ARB use (RR, 0.40; 95% CI 0.02-0.78), rather than ACEI use (RR, 0.72; 95% CI 0.36-1.09), was shown to decrease the risk of cognitive impairment of aging. In conclusion, RASB treatments, regardless of the drug class, have benefits on prevention of AD, and the effects of ACEI may analogous to ARB. However, the benefit differs according to drug classes for cognitive impairment of aging, with ARB use, rather than ACEI use, being a potential treatment for reducing the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging.",2016,Nov,J Clin Neurosci,33,,32-38,,10.1016/j.jocn.2016.02.036,27475317,#45,Zhuang 2016
Pubmed,Prophylactic cognitive enhancers for improvement of cognitive function in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Niu Y; Ye D; You Y; Wu J,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive enhancers, including cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, are used to treat dementia, but their effect for reducing post-electroconvulsive therapy (post-ECT) cognitive side effects is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of cognitive enhancers in the prevention of cognitive side effects due to ECT. METHODS: We identified relevant studies by searching electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library). Only studies published up to October 2019 comparing cognitive enhancer vs placebo for cognitive function after ECT were included. The primary outcome extracted from the studies was cognitive function score. RESULTS: Five studies with 202 patients were included in this study. The cognitive enhancer group (CEG) had a significantly higher cognitive function score. Moreover, sensitivity analysis showed that no individual study had a significant impact on the overall results. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis revealed that cognitive enhancers might improve cognitive function and reduce ECT-induced cognitive side effects. Nevertheless, more high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with long-term follow-up are still needed to make the final conclusion.",2020,Mar,Medicine (Baltimore),99,11,e19527,,10.1097/MD.0000000000019527,32176105,#43,Niu 2020
Pubmed,Alzheimer's Disease and Exercise: A Literature Review.,Cass SP,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs memory and cognitive judgment. It is the leading cause of dementia in late adult life and is associated with a significant social burden and increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Because of mixed effectiveness of medications, exercise has been considered as a treatment for pre-clinical AD, late stage AD, and as a prevention strategy. Exercise appears to improve brain blood flow, increase hippocampal volume, and improve neurogenesis. Prospective studies indicate that physical inactivity is one of the most common preventable risk factors for developing AD and that higher physical activity levels are associated with a reduced risk of development of disease. Exercise as a treatment for AD shows improvement in cognitive function, decreased neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a slower decline in activities of daily living (ADL). Exercise has been shown to have fewer side effects and better adherence compared to medications.",2017,Jan/Feb,Curr Sports Med Rep,16,1,19-22,,10.1249/JSR.0000000000000332,28067736,#530,Cass 2017

To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and AÎ_ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.32â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-7)), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified.

Pubmed,Risk factors associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review of the evidence.,Hersi M; Irvine B; Gupta P; Gomes J; Birkett N; Krewski D,"A systematic review was conducted to identify risk factors associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moderate and high quality systematic reviews were eligible for inclusion. Primary studies reporting on non-genetic risk factors associated with neuropathologically or clinically confirmed AD were considered. Eighty one systematic reviews reporting on AD onset and 12 reporting on progression satisfied the eligibility criteria. Four hundred and thirty-two relevant primary studies reporting on onset were identified; however, only those published between 2010 and 2012 (n=65) were included in the qualitative synthesis. Several factors including statins, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, compliance with a Mediterranean diet, higher educational attainment, physically and cognitively stimulating activities, and APOE Îµ2 appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of AD onset. The evidence was suggestive of an increased risk of AD associated with head injury in males, age, diabetes mellitus, conjugated equine estrogen use with medroxyprogesterone acetate, current smoking, and lower social engagement. With respect to genetic factors, APOE Îµ4 remained the strongest predictor of AD. Physical and cognitive activities were associated with a beneficial effect on cognitive function and other indicators of dementia progression while higher educational attainment was associated with faster cognitive decline. Although suggestive of an association, the current evidence for a majority of the identified putative factors for AD onset and progression was weak, at best due to conflicting findings across studies or inadequate evidence.

The aim of our present systematic review and meta-analysis was to roundly evaluate the association between AD and its modifiable risk factors. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to July 2014, and the references of retrieved relevant articles. We included prospective cohort studies and retrospective case-control studies. RESULTS: 16,906 articles were identified of which 323 with 93 factors met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Among factors with relatively strong evidence (pooled population >5000) in our meta-analysis, we found grade I evidence for 4 medical exposures (oestrogen, statin, antihypertensive medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs therapy) as well as 4 dietary exposures (folate, vitamin E/C and coffee) as protective factors of AD. We found grade I evidence showing that one biochemical exposure (hyperhomocysteine) and one psychological condition (depression) significantly increase risk of developing AD. We also found grade I evidence indicative of complex roles of pre-existing disease (frailty, carotid atherosclerosis, hypertension, low diastolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes mellitus (Asian population) increasing risk whereas history of arthritis, heart disease, metabolic syndrome and cancer decreasing risk) and lifestyle (low education, high body mass index (BMI) in mid-life and low BMI increasing the risk whereas cognitive activity, current smoking (Western population), light-to-moderate drinking, stress, high BMI in late-life decreasing the risk) in influencing AD risk.

Pubmed,Potential for primary prevention of Alzheimer's disease: an analysis of population-based data.,Norton S; Matthews FE; Barnes DE; Yaffe K; Brayne C,"BACKGROUND: Recent estimates suggesting that over half of Alzheimer's disease burden worldwide might be attributed to potentially modifiable risk factors do not take into account risk-factor non-independence. We aimed to provide specific estimates of preventive potential by accounting for the association between risk factors. METHODS: Using relative risks from existing meta-analyses, we estimated the population-attributable risk (PAR) of Alzheimer's disease worldwide and in the USA, Europe, and the UK for seven potentially modifiable risk factors that have consistent evidence of an association with the disease (diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, physical inactivity, depression, smoking, and low educational attainment). The combined PAR associated with the risk factors was calculated using data from the Health Survey for England 2006 to estimate and adjust for the association between risk factors. The potential of risk factor reduction was assessed by examining the combined effect of relative reductions of 10% and 20% per decade for each of the seven risk factors on projections for Alzheimer's disease cases to 2050. FINDINGS: Worldwide, the highest estimated PAR was for low educational attainment (19Â·1%, 95% CI 12Â·3-25Â·6). The highest estimated PAR was for physical inactivity in the USA (21Â·0%, 95% CI 5Â·8-36Â·6), Europe (20Â·3%, 5Â·6-35Â·6), and the UK (21Â·8%, 6Â·1-37Â·7). Assuming independence, the combined worldwide PAR for the seven risk factors was 49Â·4% (95% CI 25Â·7-68Â·4), which equates to 16Â·8 million attributable cases (95% CI 8Â·7-23Â·2 million) of 33Â·9 million cases. However, after adjustment for the association between the risk factors, the estimate reduced to 28Â·2% (95% CI 14Â·2-41Â·5), which equates to 9Â·6 million attributable cases (95% CI 4Â·8-14Â·1 million) of 33Â·9 million cases. Combined PAR estimates were about 30% for the USA, Europe, and the UK. Assuming a causal relation and intervention at the correct age for prevention, relative reductions of 10% per decade in the prevalence of each of the seven risk factors could reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in 2050 by 8Â·3% worldwide. INTERPRETATION: After accounting for non-independence between risk factors, around a third of Alzheimer's diseases cases worldwide might be attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors. Alzheimer's disease incidence might be reduced through improved access to education and use of effective methods targeted at reducing the prevalence of vascular risk factors (eg, physical inactivity, smoking, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, and diabetes) and depression.

METHODS: Review of the literature using searches of Medline, Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and meeting abstracts and presentations. RESULTS: The role of alcohol as a risk factor and contributor for cognitive decline associated withÂ AD has received little attention. This is despite the high prevalence of alcohol use, the potential reversibility of a degree of cognitive impairment and the global burden of AD. Until now the focus has largely been on the toxic effects of alcohol, neuronal loss and the role of thiamine. CONCLUSION: We propose alcohol adds to the cognitive burden seen in dementia through additional mechanisms to neurodegenerative processes or may contribute at various mechanistic points in the genesis and sustenance of AD pathology via neuroinflammation. We describe the common underlying neurobiology in alcohol and AD, and examine ways alcohol likely contributes to neuroinflammation directly via stimulation of Toll-like receptors and indirectly from small bowel changes, hepatic changes, withdrawal and traumatic brain injury to the pathogenesis of AD.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of 19 prospective observational cohort studies. DATA SOURCES: The Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working Populations Consortium, the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, and the UK Data Service, including a total of 19 of a potential 9741 studies. REVIEW METHOD: The search strategy was designed to retrieve individual-participant data from prospective cohort studies. Exposure was physical inactivity; primary outcomes were incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease; and the secondary outcome was incident cardiometabolic disease (that is, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke). Summary estimates were obtained using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Study population included 404â€‰840 people (mean age 45.5 years, 57.7% women) who were initially free of dementia, had a measurement of physical inactivity at study entry, and were linked to electronic health records. In 6.0 million person-years at risk, we recorded 2044 incident cases of all-cause dementia. In studies with data on dementia subtype, the number of incident cases of Alzheimer's disease was 1602 in 5.2 million person-years. When measured <10 years before dementia diagnosis (that is, the preclinical stage of dementia), physical inactivity was associated with increased incidence of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.71) and Alzheimer's disease (1.36, 1.12 to 1.65). When reverse causation was minimised by assessing physical activity â‰¥10 years before dementia onset, no difference in dementia risk between physically active and inactive participants was observed (hazard ratios 1.01 (0.89 to 1.14) and 0.96 (0.85 to 1.08) for the two outcomes). Physical inactivity was consistently associated with increased risk of incident diabetes (hazard ratio 1.42, 1.25 to 1.61), coronary heart disease (1.24, 1.13 to 1.36), and stroke (1.16, 1.05 to 1.27). Among people in whom cardiometabolic disease preceded dementia, physical inactivity was non-significantly associated with dementia (hazard ratio for physical activity assessed >10 before dementia onset 1.30, 0.79 to 2.14). CONCLUSIONS: In analyses that addressed bias due to reverse causation, physical inactivity was not associated with all-cause dementia or Alzheimer's disease, although an indication of excess dementia risk was observed in a subgroup of physically inactive individuals who developed cardiometabolic disease.",2019,Apr,BMJ,365,,l1495,,10.1136/bmj.l1495,30995986,#512,KivimÃ_ki 2019
Pubmed,Environmental risk factors for dementia: a systematic review.,Killin LO; Starr JM; Shiue IJ; Russ TC,"BACKGROUND: Dementia risk reduction is a major and growing public health priority. While certain modifiable risk factors for dementia have been identified, there remains a substantial proportion of unexplained risk. There is evidence that environmental risk factors may explain some of this risk. Thus, we present the first comprehensive systematic review of environmental risk factors for dementia. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases from their inception to January 2016, bibliographies of review articles, and articles related to publically available environmental data. Articles were included if they examined the association between an environmental risk factor and dementia. Studies with another outcome (for example, cognition), a physiological measure of the exposure, case studies, animal studies, and studies of nutrition were excluded. Data were extracted from individual studies which were, in turn, appraised for methodological quality. The strength and consistency of the overall evidence for each risk factor identified was assessed. RESULTS: We screened 4784 studies and included 60 in the review. Risk factors were considered in six categories: air quality, toxic heavy metals, other metals, other trace elements, occupational-related exposures, and miscellaneous environmental factors. Few studies took a life course approach. There is at least moderate evidence implicating the following risk factors: air pollution; aluminium; silicon; selenium; pesticides; vitamin D deficiency; and electric and magnetic fields. CONCLUSIONS: Studies varied widely in size and quality and therefore we must be circumspect in our conclusions. Nevertheless, this extensive review suggests that future research could focus on a short list of environmental risk factors for dementia. Furthermore, further robust, longitudinal studies with repeated measures of environmental exposures are required to confirm these associations.",2016,Oct,BMC Geriatr,16,1,175,,10.1186/s12877-016-0342-y,27729011,#511,Killin 2016

A comprehensive systematic literature search identified 19 longitudinal cohort studies investigating the association between various social relationship factors and incident dementia in the general population. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Low social participation (RR: 1.41 (95% CI: 1.13-1.75)), less frequent social contact (RR: 1.57 (95% CI: 1.32-1.85)), and more loneliness (RR: 1.58 (95% CI: 1.19-2.09)) were statistically significant associated with incident dementia. The results of the association between social network size and dementia were inconsistent. No statistically significant association was found for low satisfaction with social network and the onset of dementia (RR: 1.25 (95% CI: 0.96-1.62). We conclude that social relationship factors that represent a lack of social interaction are associated with incident dementia.

Pubmed,Antihypertensive medications and risk for incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from prospective cohort studies.,Ding J; Davis-Plourde KL; Sedaghat S; Tully PJ; Wang W; Phillips C; Pase MP; Himali JJ; Gwen Windham B; Griswold M; Gottesman R; Mosley TH; White L; GuÃ°nason V; Debette S; Beiser AS; Seshadri S; Ikram MA; Meirelles O; Tzourio C; Launer LJ,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a major health concern for which prevention and treatment strategies remain elusive. Lowering high blood pressure with specific antihypertensive medications (AHMs) could reduce the burden of disease. We investigated whether specific AHM classes reduced the risk for dementia. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of individual participant data from eligible observational studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and Jan 1, 2019. Cohorts were eligible for inclusion if they prospectively recruited community-dwelling adults; included more than 2000 participants; collected data for dementia events over at least 5 years; had measured blood pressure and verified use of AHMs; included in-person exams, supplemented with additional data, to capture dementia events; and had followed up cases for mortality. We assessed the association of incident dementia and clinical Alzheimer's disease with use of five AHM classes, within strata of baseline high (systolic blood pressure [SBP] â‰¥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] â‰¥90 mm Hg) and normal (SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP <90 mm Hg) blood pressure. We used a propensity score to control for confounding factors related to the probability of receiving AHM. Study-specific effect estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Six prospective community-based studies (n=31â€ˆ090 well phenotyped dementia-free adults older than 55 years) with median follow-ups across cohorts of 7-22 years were eligible for analysis. There were 3728 incident cases of dementia and 1741 incident Alzheimer's disease diagnoses. In the high blood pressure stratum (n=15â€ˆ537), those using any AHM had a reduced risk for developing dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·88, 95% CI 0Â·79-0Â·98; p=0Â·019) and Alzheimer's disease (HR 0Â·84, 0Â·73-0Â·97; p=0Â·021) compared with those not using AHM. We did not find any significant differences between one drug class versus all others on risk of dementia. In the normal blood pressure stratum (n=15 553), there was no association between AHM use and incident dementia or Alzheimer's disease. INTERPRETATION: Over a long period of observation, no evidence was found that a specific AHM drug class was more effective than others in lowering risk of dementia. Among people with hypertensive levels of blood pressure, use of any AHM with efficacy to lower blood pressure might reduce the risk for dementia. These findings suggest future clinical guidelines for hypertension management should also consider the beneficial effect of AHM on the risk for dementia.

Pubmed,"Recent global trends in the prevalence and incidence of dementia, and survival with dementia.",Prince M; Ali GC; Guerchet M; Prina AM; Albanese E; Wu YT,"BACKGROUND: Current projections of the scale of the coming dementia epidemic assume that the age- and sex-specific prevalence of dementia will not vary over time, and that population ageing alone (increasing the number of older people at risk) drives the projected increases. The basis for this assumption is doubtful, and secular trends (that is, gradual decreases or increases in prevalence over long-term periods) are perfectly plausible. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of studies of trends in prevalence, incidence and mortality for people with dementia, conducted since 1980. RESULTS: We identified nine studies that had tracked dementia prevalence, eight that had tracked dementia incidence, and four that had tracked mortality among people with dementia. There was some moderately consistent evidence to suggest that the incidence of dementia may be declining in high-income countries. Evidence on trends in the prevalence of dementia were inconsistent across studies and did not suggest any clear overall effect. Declining incidence may be balanced by longer survival with dementia, although mortality trends have been little studied. There is some evidence to suggest increasing prevalence in East Asia, consistent with worsening cardiovascular risk factor profiles, although secular changes in diagnostic criteria may also have contributed. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to suggest that the current assumption of constant age-specific prevalence of dementia over time is ill-founded. However, there remains some uncertainty as to the future scale of the dementia epidemic. Population ageing seems destined to play the greatest role, and prudent policymakers should plan future service provision based upon current prevalence projections. Additional priorities should include investing in brain health promotion and dementia prevention programs, and monitoring the future course of the epidemic to chart the effectiveness of these measures.",2016,Jul,Alzheimers Res Ther,8,1,23,,10.1186/s13195-016-0188-8,27473681,#506,Prince 2016
Pubmed,Metformin Use Associated with Reduced Risk of Dementia in Patients with Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Campbell JM; Stephenson MD; de Courten B; Chapman I; Bellman SM; Aromataris E,"BACKGROUND: Metformin, a first line antihyperglycemic medication, is an AMPK activator and has been hypothesized to act as a geroprotective agent. Studies on its association with various classifications of age-related cognitive decline have shown mixed results with positive and negative findings. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the best available evidence on the association of metformin-use with risk, progression, and severity of dementia. METHOD: Eligible research investigated the effect of metformin on dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or any measure of cognitive impairment compared to any control group who were not receiving metformin. The initial search resulted in 862 citations from which 14 studies (seven cohort, four cross-sectional, two RCTs, and one case control) were included. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of three studies showed that cognitive impairment was significantly less prevalent in diabetic metformin (Odds ratioâ€_=â€_0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78), while six studies showed that dementia incidence was also significantly reduced (Hazard ratioâ€_=â€_0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.88). Mini-Mental State Examination scores were not significantly affected by metformin-use, although both RCTs showed that metformin had a neuroprotective effect compared to placebo. Some studies found negative or neutral effects for metformin use by people with diabetes; the potential mechanism of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin should continue to be used as a first line therapy for diabetes in patients at risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The use of metformin by individuals without diabetes for the prevention of dementia is not supported by the available evidence.",2018,,J Alzheimers Dis,65,4,1225-1236,,10.3233/JAD-180263,30149446,#503,Campbell 2018

Pubmed,Epidemiologic studies of modifiable factors associated with cognition and dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis.,Beydoun MA; Beydoun HA; Gamaldo AA; Teel A; Zonderman AB; Wang Y,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment, including dementia, is a major health concern with the increasing aging population. Preventive measures to delay cognitive decline are of utmost importance. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia, increasing in prevalence from <1% below the age of 60 years to >40% above 85 years of age. METHODS: We systematically reviewed selected modifiable factors such as education, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, caffeine, antioxidants, homocysteine (Hcy), n-3 fatty acids that were studied in relation to various cognitive health outcomes, including incident AD. We searched MEDLINE for published literature (January 1990 through October 2012), including cross-sectional and cohort studies (sample sizes > 300). Analyses compared study finding consistency across factors, study designs and study-level characteristics. Selecting studies of incident AD, our meta-analysis estimated pooled risk ratios (RR), population attributable risk percent (PAR%) and assessed publication bias. RESULTS: In total, 247 studies were retrieved for systematic review. Consistency analysis for each risk factor suggested positive findings ranging from ~38.9% for caffeine to ~89% for physical activity. Education also had a significantly higher propensity for ""a positive finding"" compared to caffeine, smoking and antioxidant-related studies. Meta-analysis of 31 studies with incident AD yielded pooled RR for low education (RR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.30-3.04), high Hcy (RR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.50-2.49), and current/ever smoking status (RR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.23-1.52) while indicating protective effects of higher physical activity and n-3 fatty acids. Estimated PAR% were particularly high for physical activity (PAR% = 31.9; 95% CI: 22.7-41.2) and smoking (PAR% = 31.09%; 95% CI: 17.9-44.3). Overall, no significant publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: Higher Hcy levels, lower educational attainment, and decreased physical activity were particularly strong predictors of incident AD. Further studies are needed to support other potential modifiable protective factors, such as caffeine.",2014,Jun,BMC Public Health,14,,643,,10.1186/1471-2458-14-643,24962204,#498,Beydoun 2014

We identified 12 individually modifiable interventions that can be implemented during midlife or later with the potential to ameliorate cognitive aging. For ten of these, we used PubMed databases for a systematic review of long-duration (at least 6 months), randomized, controlled trials in midlife and older adults without dementia or mild cognitive impairment with objective measures of neuropsychological performance. Using network meta-analysis, we performed a quantitative synthesis for global cognition (primary outcome) and episodic memory (secondary outcome). Of 1038 publications identified by our search strategy, 24 eligible trials were included in the network meta-analysis. Results suggested that the Mediterranean diet supplemented by olive oil and tai chi exercise may improve global cognition, and the Mediterranean diet plus olive oil and soy isoflavone supplements may improve memory. Effect sizes were no more than small (standardized mean differences 0.11-0.22). Cognitive training may have cognitive benefit as well. Most individually modifiable risk factors have not yet been adequately studied.

Pubmed,Obesity as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease: weighing the evidence.,Alford S; Patel D; Perakakis N; Mantzoros CS,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the USA today; therefore, it is imperative that public health initiatives and clinical strategies are developed to prevent and effectively treat AD. Despite the enormous impact that AD has on individuals, families, society, and the health care system, there are no biomarkers to clearly identify those at risk for AD, public health prevention strategies in place, or treatments to address the underlying pathology or stop the progression of AD. There is ample scientific as well as empirical evidence that obesity and its metabolic and vascular comorbidities are related to AD and likely in the causative pathway. Obesity prevention and treatment could prove to be an efficacious and safe approach to preventing AD, a serious and daunting epidemic disease. In this review, we present the current pathophysiological and clinical evidence linking obesity and obesity-related comorbidities (eg, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, and type 2 diabetes) with AD. Additionally, we discuss which population to target and when to consider treatment for AD. Finally, we summarize the current evidence regarding the efficacy of anti-obesity and anti-diabetic pharmacotherapeutic agents for the treatment of AD.",2018,Feb,Obes Rev,19,2,269-280,,10.1111/obr.12629,29024348,#496,Alford 2018
Pubmed,The association between dementia and epilepsy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Subota A; Pham T; JettÃ© N; Sauro K; Lorenzetti D; Holroyd-Leduc J,"OBJECTIVE: Dementia is among the top 15 conditions with the most substantial increase in burden of disease in the past decade, and along with epilepsy, among the top 25 causes of years lived with disability worldwide. The epidemiology of dementia in persons with epilepsy, and vice versa, is not well characterized. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the prevalence, incidence, and reported risk factors for dementia in epilepsy and epilepsy in dementia. METHODS: Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane databases were searched from inception. Papers were included if they reported the incidence and/or prevalence of dementia and epilepsy. Two individuals independently performed duplicate abstract and full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment. Random-effects models were used to generate pooled estimates when feasible. RESULTS: Of the 3,043 citations identified, 64 were reviewed in full text and 19 articles were included. The period prevalence of dementia ranged from 8.1 to 17.5 per 100 persons among persons with epilepsy (insufficient data to pool). The pooled period prevalence of epilepsy among persons with dementia was 5 per 100 persons (95% confidence interval [CI] 1-9) in population-based settings and 4 per 100 persons (95% CI 1-6) in clinic settings. There were insufficient data to report a pooled overall incidence rate and only limited data on risk factors.

Pubmed,Does Treating Vascular Risk Factors Prevent Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Larsson SC; Markus HS,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence has associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) with vascular risk factors (VRFs), but whether treatment of VRFs reduces the incidence of dementia and AD is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize available data on the impact of treatment of VRFs on dementia and AD incidence. METHODS: Pertinent studies published until 1 January 2018 were identified from PubMed. Both randomized controlled trials (RCT) and prospective studies that investigated the impact of treatment of VRFs on dementia or AD incidence were included. RESULTS: Eight RCTs and 52 prospective studies were identified. Antihypertensive treatment was associated with a non-significant reduced risk of dementia in RCTs (n = 5; relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.02) and prospective studies (n = 3; RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58-1.01) and with reduced AD risk in prospective studies (n = 5; RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91). In prospective studies, treatment of hyperlipidemia with statins, but not nonstatin lipid-lowering agents, was associated with reduced risk of dementia (n = 17; RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95) and AD (n = 13; RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.92). The single RCT on statins and dementia incidence showed no association. Data from one RCT and six prospective studies did not support a beneficial impact of antidiabetic drugs or insulin therapy on dementia risk. CONCLUSION: Current evidence indicates that antihypertensives and statins might reduce the incidence of dementia and AD. Further trials to determine the effect of VRF on AD are needed.",2018,,J Alzheimers Dis,64,2,657-668,,10.3233/JAD-180288,29914039,#490,Larsson 2018

This mixed-method systematic review aimed to integrate evidence of falls prevention efficacy with views/experiences of PLWD. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched. Inclusion criteria included quantitative or qualitative studies examining knowledge translation of falls prevention strategies in community-dwelling PLWD and/or their caregiver. Study quality was assessed, and findings are narratively described. RESULTS: Six quantitative and five qualitative studies were included. Study quality was mixed. Quantitative studies showed limited evidence of effectiveness on reduction in falls risk, falls and hospitalization rates, nursing home admission, decline in activities of daily living, and adherence to strategies. Qualitative themes showed inclusion of caregiver and health professionals as key to program success, but many factors influence participation. IMPLICATIONS: Synthesizing the findings generated a new understanding of falls prevention for this high-risk group. A focus upon health professional and caregiver involvement and accommodation of individual preferences may result in increased engagement with falls prevention strategies.",2015,Aug,Gerontologist,55,4,560-74,,10.1093/geront/gnt127,24218145,#487,Meyer 2015
Pubmed,Dementia ascertainment using existing data in UK longitudinal and cohort studies: a systematic review of methodology.,Sibbett RA; Russ TC; Deary IJ; Starr JM,"BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the risk factors for or causation of dementia must consider subjects prior to disease onset. To overcome the limitations of prospective studies and self-reported recall of information, the use of existing data is key. This review provides a narrative account of dementia ascertainment methods using sources of existing data. METHODS: The literature search was performed using: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Web of Science. Included articles reported a UK-based study of dementia in which cases were ascertained using existing data. Existing data included that which was routinely collected and that which was collected for previous research. After removing duplicates, abstracts were screened and the remaining articles were included for full-text review. A quality tool was used to evaluate the description of the ascertainment methodology. RESULTS: Of the 3545 abstracts screened, 360 articles were selected for full-text review. 47 articles were included for final consideration. Data sources for ascertainment included: death records, national datasets, research databases and hospital records among others. 36 articles used existing data alone for ascertainment, of which 27 used only a single data source. The most frequently used source was a research database. Quality scores ranged from 7/16 to 16/16. Quality scores were better for articles with dementia ascertainment as an outcome. Some papers performed validation studies of dementia ascertainment and most indicated that observed rates of dementia were lower than expected. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a lack of consistency in dementia ascertainment methodology using existing data. With no data source identified as a ""gold-standard"", we suggest the use of multiple sources. Where possible, studies should access records with evidence to confirm the diagnosis. Studies should also calculate the dementia ascertainment rate for the population being studied to enable a comparison with an expected rate.",2017,Jul,BMC Psychiatry,17,1,239,,10.1186/s12888-017-1401-4,28673273,#486,Sibbett 2017
Pubmed,A Systematic Review of Evidence for a Role of Rest-Activity Rhythms in Dementia.,Smagula SF; Gujral S; Capps CS; Krafty RT,"Background: Rest-activity rhythm (RAR) disruption may be a risk factor for dementia that can be objectively measured with wearable accelerometers. It is possible that risk monitoring and preventive interventions could be developed targeting RARs. To evaluate whether current evidence supports these applications, we systematically reviewed published studies linking RARs with dementia, its course, and mechanisms. Methods: Entering pre-defined search terms in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases returned 192 unique titles. We identified 32 articles that met our primary inclusion criteria, namely, that they examined objective RAR measures in the context of dementia, cognition, or brain biomarkers. Results: Cross-sectional studies consistently found that people with dementia had less stable (5/6 studies), more fragmented (4/6 studies), lower amplitude rhythms (5/5 studies), that had a worse fit to 24-h models (3/3 studies). Findings from studies relating RARs to cognitive test performance (rather than diagnostic status) were more nuanced. RAR fragmentation was associated with neurodegeneration biomarkers in 2/2 studies; and 1/1 study found 24-h model fit related to hippocampal hyperactivation. Although 2/2 studies found RARs related to markers of cerebrovascular disease, the specific RARs and cerebrovascular disease measures were not consistent. Longitudinal studies (3/3 articles) reported that lower amplitude and worse 24-h rhythm fit predicted future cognitive impairment and executive function. However, interventions aimed at modifying RARs had mixed effects (e.g., 0/4 studies demonstrated effects of morning light on 24-h model fit; evening light was associated with improved 24-h fit in 2/2 studies reporting); these effects may be more evident in subgroups. Conclusions: Consistent evidence shows that dementia is associated with disrupted RARs. Importantly, recent studies have shown that RAR disruption is associated with dementia biomarkers and, prospectively, with the risk of cognitive impairment. Interventions mostly tried using bright light to modify RARs in people who already have dementia; these studies produced modest effects on RARs and did not show modification of dementia's course. Altogether, these findings suggest studies are needed to understand how RARs relate to changes in brain health earlier in the disease process. Better understanding of the biopsychosocial mechanisms linking RARs with future dementia risk can help further target intervention development.",2019,,Front Psychiatry,10,,778,,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00778,31736798,#485,Smagula 2019
Pubmed,Cost-effectiveness of Occupational Therapy in Older People: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.,Nagayama H; Tomori K; Ohno K; Takahashi K; Yamauchi K,"A systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of occupational therapy for older people was conducted. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, OT seeker and unpublished trials registers were searched. Reference lists of all potentially eligible studies were searched with no language restrictions. We included trial-based full economic evaluations that considered both costs and outcomes in occupational therapy for older people compared with standard care (i.e. other therapy) or no intervention. We reviewed each trial for methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed the quality of economic evaluations using a Drummond checklist. In the results of this review, we included five eligible studies (1-5) that were randomized controlled trials with high-quality economic evaluation. Two studies were full economic evaluations of interventions for fall prevention (1 and 2); two studies were full economic evaluations of preventive occupational therapy interventions (3 and 4; one was a comparison of an occupational therapy group with a social work group); one study was a full economic evaluation of occupational therapy for individuals with dementia (5). Two of the studies (one was preventive occupational therapy [3] and the other was occupational therapy for dementia [5]) found a significant effect and confirmed the cost-effectiveness of occupational therapy for older people compared with the control group. These studies found that occupational therapy for older people was clinically effective and cost-effective in comparison with standard care or other therapies. With reference to their clinical implication, these intervention studies (using a client-centred approach) suggested potentially cost-effective means to motivate clients to maintain their own health. However, this review has limitations because of the high heterogeneity of the reviewed studies on full economic evaluations of occupational therapy for older people. Future studies on the cost-effectiveness of occupational therapy in older people are strongly warranted.

Pubmed,What Do We Know About Behavioral Crises in Dementia? A Systematic Review.,Backhouse T; Camino J; Mioshi E,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral crises in dementia are represented by a wide variety of symptoms, regularly require external intervention from professionals, and are reported as a risk factor for hospital admission. Little is known about the factors that are associated with them. OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with dementia-related behavioral crises. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and AMED databases. An additional lateral search including reference lists was conducted. Two researchers screened all records for potential eligibility. Narrative synthesis was used to bring together the findings. RESULTS: Out of the 5,544 records identified, 24 articles (18 distinct studies) met the eligibility criteria. Aggression and agitation were the most common behaviors present at crises. Delusions, wandering/absconding, and hallucinations were also key behaviors contributing to crises. Behavioral crises predominantly happened in the severe stages of dementia (according to MMSE scores), in people with dementia residing in their own homes and in long-term care, and were the catalyst for admissions to psychiatric inpatient settings, specialist-care units, long-term care settings, or for referrals to psychiatric community services. Lack of consistency in assessment of behavior, and management of agitation/aggression in dementia crises were evident. CONCLUSION: Interventions to reduce the likelihood of people with dementia-related behaviors reaching crisis point need to focus on both family and care home settings and incorporate aggression and agitation management. Future research should focus on determining the factors that could be addressed to prevent behavioral crises and the interventions and models of care that may help to prevent crises.",2018,,J Alzheimers Dis,62,1,99-113,,10.3233/JAD-170679,29439334,#482,Backhouse 2018
Pubmed,Primary prevention of dementia: from modifiable risk factors to a public brain health agenda?,Hussenoeder FS; Riedel-Heller SG,"INTRODUCTION: With large numbers of people affected, no treatment in sight and continuing demographic change, the prevention of dementia is becoming a central public health issue. METHODS: We conducted a systematic meta-review including systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies on modifiable risk and protective factors for dementia published over the last 5Â years. RESULTS: Compelling evidence on a number of modifiable risk factors, mostly lifestyle factors, is available from longitudinal observational studies to inform primary preventive efforts. DISCUSSION: Evidence stemming from preventive RCTs is limited. However, multi-domain interventions addressing a variety of risk factors at once seem promising with regard to high-risk individuals (selective preventive approach). However, we argue that it is time to move forward and discuss a public brain health agenda as a universal preventive approach. Based on a risk reduction strategy, the public brain health agenda suggests the following ten key actions: (1) increase physical activity, (2) foster social integration, (3) improve education and foster lifelong learning, (4) provide mentally stimulating workplaces, (5) foster a cognitively active lifestyle, (6) propose a healthy Mediterranean-like diet, (7) reduce alcohol consumption, (8) stop smoking, (9) prevent, diagnose and treat chronic conditions, and (10) reduce anticholinergic medication in the elderly.",2018,Dec,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,53,12,1289-1301,,10.1007/s00127-018-1598-7,30255384,#480,Hussenoeder 2018
Pubmed,"Dietary patterns, cognitive decline, and dementia: a systematic review.",van de Rest O; Berendsen AA; Haveman-Nies A; de Groot LC,"Nutrition is an important modifiable risk factor that plays a role in the strategy to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Research on nutritional effects has until now mainly focused on the role of individual nutrients and bioactive components. However, the evidence for combined effects, such as multinutrient approaches, or a healthy dietary pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet, is growing. These approaches incorporate the complexity of the diet and possible interaction and synergy between nutrients. Over the past few years, dietary patterns have increasingly been investigated to better understand the link between diet, cognitive decline, and dementia. In this systematic review we provide an overview of the literature on human studies up to May 2014 that examined the role of dietary patterns (derived both a priori as well as a posteriori) in relation to cognitive decline or dementia. The results suggest that better adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with less cognitive decline, dementia, or Alzheimer disease, as shown by 4 of 6 cross-sectional studies, 6 of 12 longitudinal studies, 1 trial, and 3 meta-analyses. Other healthy dietary patterns, derived both a priori (e.g., Healthy Diet Indicator, Healthy Eating Index, and Program National Nutrition SantÃ© guideline score) and a posteriori (e.g., factor analysis, cluster analysis, and reduced rank regression), were shown to be associated with reduced cognitive decline and/or a reduced risk of dementia as shown by all 6 cross-sectional studies and 6 of 8 longitudinal studies. More conclusive evidence is needed to reach more targeted and detailed guidelines to prevent or postpone cognitive decline.",2015,Mar,Adv Nutr,6,2,154-68,,10.3945/an.114.007617,25770254,#475,vandeRest 2015
Pubmed,Association between Development of Dementia and Use of Benzodiazepines: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Lucchetta RC; da Mata BPM; Mastroianni PC,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The use of benzodiazepines and the development of dementia is controversial, with studies indicating that benzodiazepines could be either a protective factor or a risk factor for dementia, or no association may exist between the two. Our objective was to identify whether such an association exists. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 981,133 (in the systematic review) and 980,860 (in the meta-analysis) adults or elderly individuals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A search of the PubMed, LILACS, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases, as well as a manual search of the reference lists of the included publications and reviews, was performed. We included studies that reported the incidence of dementia and in ever users of benzodiazepines. Data were analyzed by using a random effects model in R software. Quality of the evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) certainty ratings system. The results of the main meta-analysis suggest that benzodiazepines can be a risk factor for developing dementia (odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.77; I(2) = 98%; 95% prediction interval 0.58-3.25; very low certainty). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an association between the use of benzodiazepines and the development of dementia. However, the current evidence lacks the power to infer differences between the effects of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementias, long-acting and short-acting benzodiazepines, and various exposure loads (duration and dose). Future long-term prospective cohort studies are necessary, with adequate adjustments for confounding variables, strategies to minimize reverse causality, reporting of subgroups aimed at greater homogeneity of findings, adequate statistical power to identify high-magnitude effects, and defined daily dose analyses for dose-response gradient.",2018,Oct,Pharmacotherapy,38,10,1010-1020,,10.1002/phar.2170,30098211,#474,Lucchetta 2018
Pubmed,The risk of overweight/obesity in mid-life and late life for the development of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.,Pedditzi E; Peters R; Beckett N,"SCOPE: it has been suggested that overweight/obesity as a risk factor for incident dementia differs between mid-life and later life. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the up-to-date current literature to assess this. SEARCH METHODS: inclusion criteria included epidemiological longitudinal studies published up to September 2014, in participants without cognitive impairment based on evidence of cognitive assessment and aged 30 or over at baseline assessment with at least 2 years of follow-up. Pubmed, Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo and the Cochrane Library were searched using combinations of the search terms: Dementia, Alzheimer disease, Vascular Dementia, Multi-Infarct Dementia, Cognitive decline, Cognitive impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment/Obesity, Overweight, Adiposity, Waist circumference (limits: humans, English language). Handsearching of all papers meeting the inclusion criteria was performed. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: of the 1,612 abstracts identified and reviewed, 21 completely met the inclusion criteria. Being obese below the age of 65 years had a positive association on incident dementia with a risk ratio (RR) 1.41 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.20-1.66), but the opposite was seen in those aged 65 and over, RR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a positive association between obesity in mid-life and later dementia but the opposite in late life. Whether weight reduction in mid-life reduces risk is worthy of further study.",2016,Jan,Age Ageing,45,1,14-21,,10.1093/ageing/afv151,26764391,#472,Pedditzi 2016

DESIGN: Systematic review and overview of systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scopus for published studies and grey literature databases for unpublished studies from January 1990 to April 2018. METHODS: To assess evidence directly addressing our objectives, we conducted a systematic review. Because we were aware of a dearth of direct evidence, we also performed an overview of systematic reviews on leisure activities that mimic formal continuing education. We a priori established the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors independently assessed inclusion and exclusion at the abstract and full-text level, rated the risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. We resolved all discrepancies by consensus. We synthesised the available evidence narratively. RESULTS: Our searches identified 4933 citations. For the systematic review, only two publications on the same prospective cohort study (Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project) met the inclusion criteria; for the overview of reviews, we included five systematic reviews. Based on 459 participants, preliminary data of the ongoing cohort study indicated that cognitive reserve statistically significantly increased in persons attending university classes compared with the control group (92.5% vs 55.7%, p<0.01). Likewise, language processing capacities statistically significantly improved (p<0.01). Episodic memory, working memory and executive function did not differ significantly between groups. Systematic reviews consistently reported a positive association between participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities and reduced incidence of dementia and improved cognitive test performance. CONCLUSION: Available results demonstrate that cognitive reserve increases through continuing education and show a positive association of cognitive leisure activities with both improved cognitive function and lower dementia incidence.

Pubmed,Preventing The Abuse Of Residents With Dementia Or Alzheimer's Disease In The Long-Term Care Setting: A Systematic Review.,Mileski M; Lee K; Bourquard C; Cavazos B; Dusek K; Kimbrough K; Sweeney L; McClay R,"PURPOSE: The main objective of this study was to investigate abuse of residents with either dementia or Alzheimer's disease in long-term care settings, to identify facilitators and barriers surrounding implementation of systems to prevent such occurrences, and to draw conclusions on combating the issue of abuse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the Medline, CINAHL, and Academic Search Ultimate databases. With the use of key terms via Boolean search, 30 articles were obtained which were determined to be germane to research objectives. The review was conducted and structured based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Residents with dementia or Alzheimer's disease are at greater risk of abuse. The growing population could increase this problem exponentially. The most common facilitators were the introduction of policies/programs in the facility, education, and working conditions. The most cited barriers were poor training, lack of research, and working conditions in the long-term care setting. CONCLUSION: The examples given would be useful in minimizing the potential for abuse in the long-term care setting. Leadership can take an active role in the prevention of abuse of the elderly through their actions, education of employees, and changes in the work environment.",2019,,Clin Interv Aging,14,,1797-1815,,10.2147/CIA.S216678,31695349,#469,Mileski 2019
Pubmed,Risk factors and screening instruments to predict adverse outcomes for undifferentiated older emergency department patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Carpenter CR; Shelton E; Fowler S; Suffoletto B; Platts-Mills TF; Rothman RE; Hogan TM,"OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of geriatric patients experience suboptimal outcomes following episodes of emergency department (ED) care. Risk stratification screening instruments exist to distinguish vulnerable subsets, but their prognostic accuracy varies. This systematic review quantifies the prognostic accuracy of individual risk factors and ED-validated screening instruments to distinguish patients more or less likely to experience short-term adverse outcomes like unanticipated ED returns, hospital readmissions, functional decline, or death. METHODS: A medical librarian and two emergency physicians conducted a medical literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov using numerous combinations of search terms, including emergency medical services, risk stratification, geriatric, and multiple related MeSH terms in hundreds of combinations. Two authors hand-searched relevant specialty society research abstracts. Two physicians independently reviewed all abstracts and used the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies instrument to assess individual study quality. When two or more qualitatively similar studies were identified, meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-DiSc software. Primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) for predictors of adverse outcomes at 1 to 12Â months after the ED encounters. A hypothetical test-treatment threshold analysis was constructed based on the meta-analytic summary estimate of prognostic accuracy for one outcome. RESULTS: A total of 7,940 unique citations were identified yielding 34 studies for inclusion in this systematic review. Studies were significantly heterogeneous in terms of country, outcomes assessed, and the timing of post-ED outcome assessments. All studies occurred in ED settings and none used published clinical decision rule derivation methodology. Individual risk factors assessed included dementia, delirium, age, dependency, malnutrition, pressure sore risk, and self-rated health. None of these risk factors significantly increased the risk of adverse outcome (LR+ rangeÂ = 0.78 to 2.84). The absence of dependency reduces the risk of 1-year mortality (LR-Â = 0.27) and nursing home placement (LR-Â = 0.27). Five constructs of frailty were evaluated, but none increased or decreased the risk of adverse outcome. Three instruments were evaluated in the meta-analysis: Identification of Seniors at Risk, Triage Risk Screening Tool, and Variables Indicative of Placement Risk. None of these instruments significantly increased (LR+ range for various outcomesÂ = 0.98 to 1.40) or decreased (LR- rangeÂ = 0.53 to 1.11) the risk of adverse outcomes. The test threshold for 3-month functional decline based on the most accurate instrument was 42%, and the treatment threshold was 61%. CONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification of geriatric adults following ED care is limited by the lack of pragmatic, accurate, and reliable instruments. Although absence of dependency reduces the risk of 1-year mortality, no individual risk factor, frailty construct, or risk assessment instrument accurately predicts risk of adverse outcomes in older ED patients. Existing instruments designed to risk stratify older ED patients do not accurately distinguish high- or low-risk subsets. Clinicians, educators, and policy-makers should not use these instruments as valid predictors of post-ED adverse outcomes. Future research to derive and validate feasible ED instruments to distinguish vulnerable elders should employ published decision instrument methods and examine the contributions of alternative variables, such as health literacy and dementia, which often remain clinically occult.",2015,Jan,Acad Emerg Med,22,1,21-Jan,,10.1111/acem.12569,25565487,#465,Carpenter 2015
Pubmed,Natural Compounds for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy: A Systematic Review of Preclinical and Clinical Studies.,Andrade S; Ramalho MJ; Loureiro JA; Pereira MDC,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder related with the increase of age and it is the main cause of dementia in the world. AD affects cognitive functions, such as memory, with an intensity that leads to several functional losses. The continuous increase of AD incidence demands for an urgent development of effective therapeutic strategies. Despite the extensive research on this disease, only a few drugs able to delay the progression of the disease are currently available. In the last years, several compounds with pharmacological activities isolated from plants, animals and microorganisms, revealed to have beneficial effects for the treatment of AD, targeting different pathological mechanisms. Thus, a wide range of natural compounds may play a relevant role in the prevention of AD and have proven to be efficient in different preclinical and clinical studies. This work aims to review the natural compounds that until this date were described as having significant benefits for this neurological disease, focusing on studies that present clinical trials.",2019,May,Int J Mol Sci,20,9,,,10.3390/ijms20092313,31083327,#463,Andrade 2019
Pubmed,A systematic review of risk factors for delirium in the ICU.,Zaal IJ; Devlin JW; Peelen LM; Slooter AJ,"OBJECTIVE: Although numerous risk factors for delirium in the ICU have been proposed, the strength of evidence supporting each risk factor remains unclear. This study systematically identifies risk factors for delirium in critically ill adults where current evidence is strongest. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Studies published from 2000 to February 2013 that evaluated critically ill adults, not undergoing cardiac surgery, for delirium, and used either multivariable analysis or randomization to evaluate variables as potential risk factors for delirium. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted in duplicate, and quality was scored using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists (i.e., high, acceptable, and low). Using a best-evidence synthesis each variable was evaluated using 3 criteria: the number of studies investigating it, the quality of these studies, and whether the direction of association was consistent across the studies. Strengths of association were not summarized. Strength of evidence was defined as strong (consistent findings in â‰¥2 high quality studies), moderate (consistent findings in 1 high quality study and â‰¥1 acceptable quality studies), inconclusive (inconsistent findings or 1 high quality study or consistent findings in only acceptable quality/low quality studies) or no evidence available. DATA SYNTHESIS: Among 33 studies included, 70% were high quality. There was strong evidence that age, dementia, hypertension, pre-ICU emergency surgery or trauma, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, mechanical ventilation, metabolic acidosis, delirium on the prior day, and coma are risk factors for delirium, that gender is not associated with delirium, and that use of dexmedetomidine is associated with a lower delirium prevalence. There is moderate evidence that multiple organ failure is a risk factor for delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Only 11 putative risk factors for delirium are supported by either strong or moderate level of evidence. These factors should be considered when designing delirium prevention strategies or controlling for confounding in future etiologic studies.",2015,Jan,Crit Care Med,43,1,40-7,,10.1097/CCM.0000000000000625,25251759,#462,Zaal 2015
Pubmed,Genetic risk factors for cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease: a review of the literature.,Fagan ES; PihlstrÃ¸m L,"Parkinson's disease is a highly heterogeneous disorder, where genetic factors are likely to contribute to clinical variability, including susceptibility to cognitive impairment and dementia. Monogenic forms of parkinsonism show distinct cognitive profiles, yet less is known about the impact of common genetic variants on cognition in sporadic Parkinson's disease. In a systematic review of the literature, the current results from genetic association studies of cognitive outcomes are summarized and prospects and challenges for future studies are discussed. Literature searches of the PubMed database were performed and studies using statistical methods to assess associations between genetic variation and any cognitive outcome in Parkinson's disease patients were included. For each of the candidate loci investigated in several studies, the current evidence is summarized and discussed. Sixty-one articles meeting our inclusion criteria were identified, which were highly heterogeneous with respect to study design, size and cognitive outcome measures. GBA mutations have a negative impact on cognition, whereas LRRK2-associated disease may have a milder cognitive phenotype than idiopathic Parkinson's disease. For common variants, reported results are partly conflicting, even across the larger studies, with some evidence to suggest a potential effect of APOE, MAPT, COMT and SNCA on cognitive outcomes. Future investigations should aim to collect high-quality cognitive data in a standardized way that allows for direct comparison across studies and large-scale meta-analysis. Linking genetic profiles to cognitive outcomes may have an important clinical impact, facilitating the stratification of patients for clinical trials and, ultimately, individualized treatment in Parkinson's disease.",2017,Apr,Eur J Neurol,24,4,561-e20,,10.1111/ene.13258,28220571,#457,Fagan 2017
Pubmed,Strategies to improve dental health in elderly patients with cognitive impairment: A systematic review.,Rozas NS; Sadowsky JM; Jeter CB,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is the gradual loss of one's ability to learn, remember, pay attention, and make decisions. Cognitively impaired elderly people are a challenging patient population for dental health care professionals and may be at higher risk of developing oral health diseases. The authors systematically reviewed interventions effective at improving dental health in patients with cognitive impairment and described research gaps remaining. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: In a comprehensive search of multiple databases, the authors identified 2,255 studies published in the English language from 1995 through March 2016. The authors included studies if the investigators evaluated oral health measures after an intervention in patients 65 years or older with cognitive impairment or dementia. Nine full-text articles met the criteria for inclusion. RESULTS: Only 1 study was a randomized control trial, whereas all others lacked appropriate controls. Investigators studied the effects of dental treatments, battery-powered devices for oral hygiene, andÂ training of care staff members. Most interventions improved some aspect of the oral health of patients with dementia, and results were more pronounced when patients required assistance while performing oral hygiene tasks or had poor oral health at baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: A basic care plan for patients with dementia should, at the minimum, match prevention strategies recommended for healthy elderly patients. Dental health care professionals should promote oral hygiene education for caregivers for elderly patients with cognitive impairment. There is aÂ wide gap in knowledge regarding effective methods specifically toÂ improve oral health in patients with dementia.",2017,Apr,J Am Dent Assoc,148,4,236-245.e3,,10.1016/j.adaj.2016.12.022,28168970,#456,Rozas 2017
Pubmed,White Matter Hyperintensities and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: A Domain-Specific Meta-Analysis.,van den Berg E; Geerlings MI; Biessels GJ; Nederkoorn PJ; Kloppenborg RP,"BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are related to cognitive dysfunction in the general population. The clinical relevance of WMHs in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is, however, unclear. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the association of WMHs and specific cognitive domains in patients with MCI or AD. METHODS: PubMed (January 1990-January 2017) was searched for studies that used MRI to quantify WMHs, and measured cognitive functioning (â‰¥1 predefined cognitive domain with â‰¥1 test) in a well-defined population of persons diagnosed with MCI or AD. Fischer's Z was used as the common metric for effect size. Modifying effects of demographics, MMSE, and WMH location were examined. RESULTS: Twelve cross-sectional studies on AD (total nâ€_=â€_1,370, median age 75 years) and 10 studies on MCI (9 cross-sectional, 1 longitudinal; total nâ€_=â€_2,286, median age 73 years) were included. The association between WMHs and overall cognition was significantly stronger for MCI (-0.25, -0.36 to -0.14) than for AD (-0.11, -0.14 to -0.08; QMâ€_=â€_10.7, pâ€_<â€_0.05). For both groups, largest effect sizes were found in attention and executive functions (-0.26, -0.36 to -0.15) and processing speed (-0.21, -0.35 to -0.12). No significant modifying effects of age and gender were found. CONCLUSION: WMHs have a medium-sized association with different cognitive functions in patients with MCI and a small, but statistically significant, association with cognition in AD.

The objective of this article is to study personality disorder as a possible risk factor for the onset of an insane process, and to relate personality disorders of Cluster B and dementia. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out with scientific literature published up to 2015. RESULTS: Twelve of the articles that we found met the specified criteria of selection and quality and study the relationship between a personality disorder and the emergence of a dementia. Although with the studies made so far it can't be concluded that the first one is a risk factor for the second one, it has been noted, thanks to neuroimaging techniques, that patients with Cluster B personality disorders develop alterations in brain structures (in the prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortex, as well as an alteration in the NAA levels and the grey matter levels) and which are also involved in a demented process.

Pubmed,Gait parameters and characteristics associated with increased risk of falls in people with dementia: a systematic review.,Modarresi S; Divine A; Grahn JA; Overend TJ; Hunter SW,"ABSTRACTBackground:People with dementia fall twice as often and have more serious fall-related injuries than healthy older adults. While gait impairment as a generic term is understood as a fall risk factor in this population, a clear elaboration of the specific components of gait that are associated with falls risk is needed for knowledge translation to clinical practice and the development of fall prevention strategies for people with dementia. OBJECTIVE: To review gait parameters and characteristics associated with falls in people with dementia. METHODS: Electronic databases CINAHL, EMBASE, MedLine, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched (from inception to April 2017) to identify prospective cohort studies evaluating the association between gait and falls in people with dementia. RESULTS: Increased double support time variability, use of mobility aids, walking outdoors, higher scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and lower average walking bouts were associated with elevated risk of any fall. Increased double support time and step length variability were associated with recurrent falls. The reviewed articles do not support using the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment and the Timed Up-and-Go tests to predict any fall in this population. There is limited research on the use of dual-task gait assessments for predicting falls in people with dementia.

A meta-analysis of population-based studies.,Huang CH; Lin CW; Lee YC; Huang CY; Huang RY; Tai YC; Wang KW; Yang SN; Sun YT; Wang HK,"BACKGROUND: To determine the association of prior traumatic brain injury (TBI) with subsequent diagnosis of neurodegeneration disease. METHODS: All studies from 1980 to 2016 reporting TBI as a risk factor for diagnoses of interest were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, study references, and review articles. The data and study design were assessed by 2 investigators independently. A meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: There were 18 studies comprising 3,263,207 patients. Meta-analysis revealed a significant association of prior TBI with subsequent dementia. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for TBI on development of dementia, FTD and TDP-43 associated disease were 1.93 (95% CI 1.47-2.55, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), 4.44 (95% CI 3.86-5.10, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and 2.97 (95% CI 1.35-6.53, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). However, analyses of individual diagnoses found no evidence that the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease in individuals with previous TBI compared to those without TBI. CONCLUSIONS: History of TBI is not associated with the development of subsequent neurodegeneration disease.

Pubmed,"Mild cognitive impairment and progression to dementia in people with diabetes, prediabetes and metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",Pal K; Mukadam N; Petersen I; Cooper C,"PURPOSE: We aimed to quantify the relative risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia in people with and without diabetes, and with and without the MetS (MetS); and to identify potential modifiers of the risk of progression from MCI to dementia in people with diabetes or MetS. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycArticles and Web of Science from inception through to 20th March 2018. Where possible, the results from three or more studies were pooled in a meta-analysis, while other findings have been described narratively. RESULTS: We included 15 articles reporting 12 studies (6865 participants). The overall unadjusted pooled odds ratio for the progression of MCI to dementia in people with diabetes/MetS was 1.67 (95% CI 1.27-2.19); the pooled odds ratio for progression in diabetesâ€‰+â€‰MCI was 1.53 (95% CI 1.20-1.97) and in people with MetSâ€‰+â€‰MCI was 2.95 (95% CI 1.23-7.05). There was moderate heterogeneity in the included studies (I(2)â€‰<â€‰60%). In diabetes, a longer duration of diabetes and the presence of retinopathy were associated with an increased risk of progression, while the use of statins and oral hypoglycaemic agents reduced the risk. Having multiple cardiovascular risk factors was a significant risk factor for progression from MCI to dementia in people with MetS. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and MetS were both associated with an increased incidence of dementia when co-existing with MCI. Intensive cardiovascular risk reduction and lifestyle changes for patients presenting with MCI and diabetes, prediabetes or MetS may be important in reducing incidence of dementia in this high risk population.",2018,Nov,Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,53,11,1149-1160,,10.1007/s00127-018-1581-3,30182156,#445,Pal 2018
Pubmed,Metabolic Syndrome and cognitive decline in the elderly: A systematic review.,Assuncao N; Sudo FK; Drummond C; de Felice FG; Mattos P,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) refers to a cluster of metabolic disturbances which is associated with increased risk for vascular and degenerative conditions in general population. Although the relationship between vascular risk factors and dementia is undisputable, additional hazard for cognitive decline in older population with concurrent metabolic disorders still waits to be demonstrated. The present review aims to analyze data on MetS and risk for cognitive decline in elderly persons. METHODS: Database searches were performed in Medline, ISI and PsycINFO for articles assessing cognitive performances of older subjects with MetS. RESULTS: Of a total of 505 studies, 25 were selected for the review. Risk of selection biases was identified in all the studies. Although all articles followed recognized diagnostic recommendations for MetS, minor criteria modifications were detected in most of them. Hyperglycemia was consistently associated with impaired cognitive performances in older individuals, but the role of MetS for cognitive decline and for the onset of dementia showed heterogeneous results. DISCUSSION: Current available data in the literature concerning the impact of MetS on the cognition of older population is inconclusive and based on inconsistent evidence. Differential effects of individual MetS components and factors associated with the age of the sample may have accounted for divergent findings among articles, but larger and higher quality studies in this field are still needed.",2018,,PLoS One,13,3,e0194990,,10.1371/journal.pone.0194990,29579115,#444,Assuncao 2018
Pubmed,Meta-analysis of Prevalence and Risk Factors for Delirium After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,Tilley E; Psaltis PJ; Loetscher T; Davis DH; Harrison SL; Kim S; Keage HAD,"Delirium is a severe and common complication following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We sought to identify the prevalence and risk factors associated with the development of postprocedural delirium in patients aged over 60 years who underwent elective TAVI for aortic stenosis. Overall, 1,051 articles were searched, from which 9 studies were included. The prevalence of delirium following TAVI was higher in studies that assessed delirium for a minimum of 3 consecutive days (24.9%) compared with the studies that did not (2%). There were large effect sizes (d > 0.8) for 3 risk factors: acute kidney injury (odds ratio [OR] 5, p < 0.001), transapical approach (OR 4, p < 0.001) and carotid artery disease (OR 4, p < 0.001), whilst small effect sizes were found for a history of atrial fibrillation, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and prior cognitive impairment. In conclusion, 23% of patients 60 years and over who underwent TAVI experience delirium, a preventative cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. Recognition of risk factors for delirium after TAVI, such as a history of carotid artery disease, development of acute kidney injury, or use of a transapical approach, provides an opportunity to implement proven delirium preventative measures.",2018,Dec,Am J Cardiol,122,11,1917-1923,,10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.08.037,30293651,#443,Tilley 2018
Pubmed,Association of traumatic brain injury with subsequent neurological and psychiatric disease: a meta-analysis.,Perry DC; Sturm VE; Peterson MJ; Pieper CF; Bullock T; Boeve BF; Miller BL; Guskiewicz KM; Berger MS; Kramer JH; Welsh-Bohmer KA,"OBJECTIVE: Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, and other illnesses. This study's objective was to determine the association of prior mild TBI with the subsequent diagnosis (that is, at least 1 year postinjury) of neurological or psychiatric disease. METHODS: All studies from January 1995 to February 2012 reporting TBI as a risk factor for diagnoses of interest were identified by searching PubMed, study references, and review articles. Reviewers abstracted the data and assessed study designs and characteristics. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analysis revealed a significant association of prior TBI with subsequent neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the development of any illness subsequent to prior TBI was 1.67 (95% CI 1.44-1.93, p < 0.0001). Prior TBI was independently associated with both neurological (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.83, p < 0.0001) and psychiatric (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.50-2.66, p < 0.0001) outcomes. Analyses of individual diagnoses revealed higher odds of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, depression, mixed affective disorders, and bipolar disorder in individuals with previous TBI as compared to those without TBI. This association was present when examining only studies of mild TBI and when considering the influence of study design and characteristics. Analysis of a subset of studies demonstrated no evidence that multiple TBIs were associated with higher odds of disease than a single TBI. CONCLUSIONS: History of TBI, including mild TBI, is associated with the development of neurological and psychiatric illness. This finding indicates that either TBI is a risk factor for heterogeneous pathological processes or that TBI may contribute to a common pathological mechanism.",2016,Feb,J Neurosurg,124,2,511-26,,10.3171/2015.2.JNS14503,26315003,#442,Perry 2016
Pubmed,What is the association between sedentary behaviour and cognitive function? A systematic review.,Falck RS; Davis JC; Liu-Ambrose T,"AIM: The increasing rate of all-cause dementia worldwide and the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatments emphasise the value of lifestyle approaches as prevention strategies. Emerging evidence suggests sedentary behaviour is associated with impaired cognitive function. A better understanding of this association would significantly add to our knowledge of how to best promote healthy cognitive ageing. Thus, we conducted a systematic review ascertaining the contribution of sedentary behaviour towards associated changes in cognitive function over the adult lifespan. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature examining the association of sedentary behaviour with cognition. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, EBSCO and Web of Science, and reference lists of relevant reviews on sedentary behaviour. Two independent reviewers extracted (1) study characteristics and (2) information regarding measurement of sedentary behaviour and cognitive function. We also assessed study quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We limited search results to adults â‰¥40â€…years, observational studies published in English since 1990 and studies investigating associations between sedentary behaviour and cognitive function. RESULTS: 8 studies examined the association of sedentary behaviour with cognitive function. 6 studies reported significant negative associations between sedentary behaviour and cognitive function. 8 different measures of sedentary behaviour and 13 different measures of cognitive function were used across all eight studies. SUMMARY: Sedentary behaviour is associated with lower cognitive performance, although the attributable risk of sedentary time to all-cause dementia incidence is unclear. Our systematic review provides evidence that limiting sedentary time and concomitantly engaging in regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity may best promote healthy cognitive ageing.",2017,May,Br J Sports Med,51,10,800-811,,10.1136/bjsports-2015-095551,27153869,#441,Falck 2017
Pubmed,Postoperative delirium after hip surgery is a potential risk factor for incident dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.,Lee SJ; Jung SH; Lee SU; Lim JY; Yoon KS; Lee SY,"BACKGROUND: Although a few trials have explored the relationship between postoperative delirium (POD) and incident dementia in patients with hip surgery, the numbers of participants in each study are relatively small. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to examine whether POD after hip surgery is a risk factor for incident dementia. METHODS: Six prospective cohort studies investigating the development of incident dementia in patients with POD after hip surgery were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. We performed a pairwise meta-analysis using fixed- and random- effect models. RESULTS: POD significantly increased the risk of incident dementia and cognitive decline (overall odds ratio [ORs]â€¯=â€¯8.957; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 5.444-14.737; Pâ€¯<â€¯ 0.001 in fixed-effects model; overall ORs = 8.962; 95 % CI, 5.344-15.029; Pâ€¯<â€¯ 0.001 in random-effects model).

Pubmed,Individualized home-based exercise programs for older people to reduce falls and improve physical performance: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Hill KD; Hunter SW; Batchelor FA; Cavalheri V; Burton E,"There is considerable diversity in the types of exercise programs investigated to reduce falls in older people. The purpose of this paper was to review the effectiveness of individualized (tailored) home-based exercise programs in reducing falls and improving physical performance among older people living in the community. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of randomized or quasi-randomized trials that utilized an individualized home-based exercise program with at least one falls outcome measure reported. Single intervention exercise studies, and multifactorial interventions where results for an exercise intervention were reported independently were included. Two researchers independently rated the quality of each included study. Of 16,871 papers identified from six databases, 12 met all inclusion criteria (11 randomized trials and a pragmatic trial). Study quality overall was high. Sample sizes ranged from 40 to 981, participants had an average age 80.1 years, and although the majority of studies targeted the general older population, several studies included clinical groups as their target (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and hip fracture). The meta-analysis results for the five studies reporting number of fallers found no significant effect of the intervention (RR [95% CI]=0.93 [0.72-1.21]), although when a sensitivity analysis was performed with one study of participants recently discharged from hospital removed, this result was significant (RR [95% CI] = 0.84 [0.72-0.99]). The meta-analysis also found that intervention led to significant improvements in physical activity, balance, mobility and muscle strength. There were no significant differences for measures of injurious falls or fractures.",2015,Sep,Maturitas,82,1,72-84,,10.1016/j.maturitas.2015.04.005,25989701,#437,Hill 2015
Pubmed,Causal inference in obesity research.,Franks PW; Atabaki-Pasdar N,"Obesity is a risk factor for a plethora of severe morbidities and premature death. Most supporting evidence comes from observational studies that are prone to chance, bias and confounding. Even data on the protective effects of weight loss from randomized controlled trials will be susceptible to confounding and bias if treatment assignment cannot be masked, which is usually the case with lifestyle and surgical interventions. Thus, whilst obesity is widely considered the major modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases, its causes and consequences are often difficult to determine. Addressing this is important, as the prevention and treatment of any disease requires that interventions focus on causal risk factors. Disease prediction, although not dependent on knowing the causes, is nevertheless enhanced by such knowledge. Here, we provide an overview of some of the barriers to causal inference in obesity research and discuss analytical approaches, such as Mendelian randomization, that can help to overcome these obstacles. In a systematic review of the literature in this field, we found: (i) probable causal relationships between adiposity and bone health/disease, cancers (colorectal, lung and kidney cancers), cardiometabolic traits (blood pressure, fasting insulin, inflammatory markers and lipids), uric acid concentrations, coronary heart disease and venous thrombosis (in the presence of pulmonary embolism), (ii) possible causal relationships between adiposity and gray matter volume, depression and common mental disorders, oesophageal cancer, macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease, diabetic kidney disease, nuclear cataract and gall stone disease, and (iii) no evidence for causal relationships between adiposity and Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer, venous thrombosis (in the absence of pulmonary embolism), liver function and periodontitis.",2017,Mar,J Intern Med,281,3,222-232,,10.1111/joim.12577,27933671,#435,Franks 2017

SUMMARY: This systematic review provides a critical analysis of the evidence linking quantitative measures of gait and balance to fall risk in older adults with dementia. Various instrumented measures of gait and postural stability including gait speed and non-instrumented performance measures including Timed Up and Go were shown to be capable of distinguishing fallers from non-fallers. Key Messages: Existing reviews indicate that impairments of gait and balance are associated with increased risk of falls in cognitively intact older people. There are inconsistencies, however, regarding the characteristics most predictive of a fall. In order to advance fall prevention efforts, there is an important need to understand the relationship between gait, balance, and fall risk, particularly in high-risk populations such as individuals with dementia.",2018,,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,45,6-May,353-367,,10.1159/000490850,30041187,#432,Dolatabadi 2018

Pubmed,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of The Effect of Low Vitamin D on Cognition.,Goodwill AM; Szoeke C,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: With an aging population and no cure for dementia on the horizon, risk factor modification prior to disease onset is an urgent health priority. Therefore, this review examined the effect of low vitamin D status or vitamin D supplementation on cognition in midlife and older adults without a diagnosis of dementia. DESIGN: Systematic review and random effect meta-analysis. SETTING: Observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort) studies comparing low and high vitamin D status and interventions comparing vitamin D supplementation with a control group were included in the review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Studies including adults and older adults without a dementia diagnosis were included. MEASUREMENTS: Medline (PubMed), AMED, Psych INFO, and Cochrane Central databases were searched for articles until August 2016. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Physiotherapy Evidence Database assessed methodological quality of all studies. RESULTS: Twenty-six observational and three intervention studies (n = 19-9,556) were included in the meta-analysis. Low vitamin D was associated with worse cognitive performance (OR = 1.24, CI = 1.14-1.35) and cognitive decline (OR = 1.26, CI = 1.09-1.23); with cross-sectional yielding a stronger effect compared to longitudinal studies. Vitamin D supplementation showed no significant benefit on cognition compared with control (SMD = 0.21, CI = -0.05 to 0.46). CONCLUSION: Observational evidence demonstrates low vitamin D is related to poorer cognition; however, interventional studies are yet to show a clear benefit from vitamin D supplementation. From the evidence to date, there is likely a therapeutic age window relevant to the development of disease and therefore vitamin D therapy. Longitudinal lifespan studies are necessary to depict the optimal timing and duration in which repletion of vitamin D may protect against cognitive decline and dementia in aging, to better inform trials and practice towards a successful therapy.",2017,Oct,J Am Geriatr Soc,65,10,2161-2168,,10.1111/jgs.15012,28758188,#427,Goodwill 2017

Estimates of the prevalence of amyloid pathology in persons without dementia are needed to understand the development of AD and to design prevention studies. OBJECTIVE: To use individual participant data meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of amyloid pathology as measured with biomarkers in participants with normal cognition, subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DATA SOURCES: Relevant biomarker studies identified by searching studies published before April 2015 using the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases and through personal communication with investigators. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they provided individual participant data for participants without dementia and used an a priori defined cutoff for amyloid positivity. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual records were provided for 2914 participants with normal cognition, 697 with SCI, and 3972 with MCI aged 18 to 100 years from 55 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of amyloid pathology on positron emission tomography or in cerebrospinal fluid according to AD risk factors (age, apolipoprotein E [APOE] genotype, sex, and education) estimated by generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The prevalence of amyloid pathology increased from age 50 to 90 years from 10% (95% CI, 8%-13%) to 44% (95% CI, 37%-51%) among participants with normal cognition; from 12% (95% CI, 8%-18%) to 43% (95% CI, 32%-55%) among patients with SCI; and from 27% (95% CI, 23%-32%) to 71% (95% CI, 66%-76%) among patients with MCI. APOE-Îµ4 carriers had 2 to 3 times higher prevalence estimates than noncarriers. The age at which 15% of the participants with normal cognition were amyloid positive was approximately 40 years for APOE Îµ4Îµ4 carriers, 50 years for Îµ2Îµ4 carriers, 55 years for Îµ3Îµ4 carriers, 65 years for Îµ3Îµ3 carriers, and 95 years for Îµ2Îµ3 carriers. Amyloid positivity was more common in highly educated participants but not associated with sex or biomarker modality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among persons without dementia, the prevalence of cerebral amyloid pathology as determined by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid findings was associated with age, APOE genotype, and presence of cognitive impairment. These findings suggest a 20- to 30-year interval between first development of amyloid positivity and onset of dementia.",2015,May,JAMA,313,19,1924-38,,10.1001/jama.2015.4668,25988462,#424,Jansen 2015
Pubmed,"Genetic variation in clusterin and risk of dementia and ischemic vascular disease in the general population: cohort studies and meta-analyses of 362,338 individuals.",Nordestgaard LT; TybjÃ_rg-Hansen A; Rasmussen KL; Nordestgaard BG; Frikke-Schmidt R,"BACKGROUND: Clusterin, also known as apolipoprotein J (apoJ), is one of the most abundantly expressed apolipoproteins in the brain after apolipoprotein E (apoE). Like the Îµ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), the clusterin gene (CLU) is a risk locus for Alzheimer's disease, and may play additional roles in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. We tested whether genetic variation in CLU was associated with either Alzheimer's disease or atherosclerosis-related diseases. METHODS: We studied individual data on 103,987 participants from the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) and the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS). We genotyped a common CLU variant (rs9331896) and two common APOE variants (rs7412 and rs429358), defining the Îµ2, Îµ3, and Îµ4, alleles in CGPS and CCHS. All individuals in the CGPS and CCHS cohorts were followed from study inclusion to occurrence of event, death, emigration, or until 10 November 2014, whichever came first. Summary consortia data on 258,351 individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics and 1000-Genomes-based genome-wide association studies (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) were used in meta-analyses. RESULTS: In CGPS and CCHS, multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for Alzheimer's disease, all dementia, vascular dementia, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease were 1.18 (1.07-1.30), 1.09 (1.02-1.17), 0.96 (0.80-1.17), 1.02 (0.97-1.07), and 0.97 (0.93-1.01) per T allele, respectively. Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for Alzheimer's disease and all dementia were 2.72 (2.45-3.01) and 2.21 (2.05-2.38) for the APOE É›4 allele. There was no interaction between rs9331896 in CLU and rs429358 (defining the É›4 allele) in APOE in predicting Alzheimer's disease or all dementia (P = 0.39 and P = 0.21). In a meta-analysis including consortium data, the overall fixed- and random-effects odds ratios for Alzheimer's disease per T allele were 1.16 (1.13-1.18) (I (2) = 0.0%; P for heterogeneity = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: A common variant in CLU was associated with a high risk of Alzheimer's disease and all dementia in the general population but not with vascular dementia or ischemic vascular disease. Important novel aspects compared to previous studies are the incorporation of individual risk factor data, the exact causative Îµ4 allele, and several subtypes of dementia and atherosclerosis-related endpoints.",2018,Mar,BMC Med,16,1,39,,10.1186/s12916-018-1029-3,29534716,#423,Nordestgaard 2018

Stress can have a damaging effect on brain health. The prognostic effect of anxiety is still unclear regarding Alzheimer's disease as well as vascular dementia.AimsTo explore the association between anxiety and future dementia. METHOD: Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and ALOIS were searched for publications up to 12 January 2018. Longitudinal studies with a follow-up of at least 2 years were included, if the trait or state anxiety had been assessed at baseline. Studies with cognitive impairment at baseline were not included. We used a random effects model to calculate the pooled time to Alzheimer's disease and incidence of vascular dementia. RESULTS: Anxiety predicts risk of Alzheimer's disease (n = 26 193 out of seven studies, hazard ratio1.53, 95% CI 1.16-2.01, P < 0.01) and vascular dementia (n = 4916 out of two studies, odds ratio1.88, 95% CI 1.05-3.36, P < 0.01).

This study examined the link between depression/anxiety/PTSD and dementia by evaluating the prevalence of these disorders in people with dementia, relative to their healthy peers. Existing meta-analyses have examined the prevalence of clinically-significant depression and anxiety in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and depression in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but have not considered vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), PTSD, or anxiety in FTD. The current meta-analysis compared the prevalence of clinically-significant depression, anxiety and PTSD in the four most common types of dementia (AD, VaD, DLB, FTD) and in unspecified dementia to that of healthy controls (PROSPERO number: CRD42017082086). PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL database searches identified 120 eligible studies. Prevalence rates were calculated for depression and anxiety in AD, VaD, DLB, FTD, unspecified dementia, and controls. PTSD data were only available for unspecified dementia. Subgroup analyses indicated that depression, but not anxiety, was more prevalent in people with dementia compared to controls; however, the anxiety analyses were probably under-powered. The results support a link between depression and dementia; however, the link between anxiety or PTSD and dementia remains unclear due to insufficient data. Longitudinal data is now needed to clarify whether depression/anxiety/PTSD may be risk factors for dementia.",2018,Dec,Neuropsychol Rev,28,4,393-416,,10.1007/s11065-018-9396-2,30536144,#419,Kuring 2018
Pubmed,Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Alzheimer's Disease in Iran: A Systematic Review.,Navipour E; Neamatshahi M; Barabadi Z; Keykhosravi A,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive decline in mental abilities and quality of life alongside behavioral abnormalities associated with high economic burden. The purpose of this study was to investigate epidemiology and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease in Iran. METHODS: In this systematic review study, both Persian and English-language databases including Medline, Google Scholar, PubMed, web of science and Magiran were searched using following keywords: epidemiology, Alzheimer, dementia and Iran without time limit up to 2017. Thirty articles abstract out of 50 studies related to this topics, were reviewed. Of which 12 full text entered into the quality assessment process and finally, four articles were selected for inclusion in this study and their results was extracted. RESULTS: The total sample size of the 4 selected studies was 2781. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the current study was estimated to be 2.3% in the population of 67-78 years old. Age, genetics, depression and hypertension were determined as the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, while daily listening to music, meeting weekly with friends and daily intake of vitamin E were considered as the factors with protective role in this disease. CONCLUSION: Alzheimer's disease is one of the main causes of functional dependence and mortality in the elderly people. Lifestyle changes and multiple mental activities in elderly increases the cognitive ability of these population, which will reduce direct and indirect costs of this disease.",2019,Dec,Iran J Public Health,48,12,2133-2139,,,31993381,#418,Navipour 2019
Pubmed,"Updated Meta-Analysis of BIN1, CR1, MS4A6A, CLU, and ABCA7 Variants in Alzheimer's Disease.",Almeida JFF; Dos Santos LR; Trancozo M; de Paula F,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated several genetic variants with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), a neurodegenerative disease. Among those, rs3764650 ABCA7, rs6656401 CR1, and rs744373 BIN1 were associated as risk factors for LOAD, while rs11136000 CLU and rs610932 MS4A6A were protective. Recently, several case-control studies have investigated the association of these polymorphisms with AD. However, not all meta-analyses analyzed these variants across different ethnic groups. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis of rs3764650 ABCA7, rs6656401 CR1, rs744373 BIN1, rs11136000 CLU, and rs610932 MS4A6A variants associated with LOAD, considering different ethnic populations. We utilized samples from 38 articles, comprising a total of 24,771 patients and 35,324 controls obtained through the PubMed database. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for polymorphisms were calculated by allelic comparison as an additive genetic model. We validated the risk for LOAD with BIN1 (rs744373), CR1 (rs6656401), and ABCA7 (rs376465), as well as the protective association for MS4A6A (rs610932) and CLU (rs11136000) variants.",2018,Mar,J Mol Neurosci,64,3,471-477,,10.1007/s12031-018-1045-y,29504051,#417,AlmeidaJFF 2018
Pubmed,Epidemiology of Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia in Arab Countries: A Systematic Review.,El-Metwally A; Toivola P; Al-Rashidi M; Nooruddin S; Jawed M; AlKanhal R; Razzak HA; Albawardi N,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Contrary to popular belief, the condition of dementia is not an actual discrete disease, but rather a group of symptoms, most notable of which is the disturbance of memory and social ability, often severe enough to impair daily functioning. As a result, it has been a major cause of functional deterioration among varying populations in the world. This study is aimed at reviewing the epidemiology of dementia in Arab countries in terms of its prevalence, distribution, and risk factors. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using articles published in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and other local journals between 1990 and 2018. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 18 studies were concluded to be eligible for the review. RESULTS: Prevalence studies demonstrated that dementia is indeed a prevalent condition in Arab countries, ranging between 1.1% and 2.3% among age groups of 50 years and older, as well as between 13.5% and 18.5% among age groups of 80 years and above. However, these results are not different from those of many other countries in the world. Moreover, prevalence was found to vary depending on sociodemographic characteristics. Major risk factors of dementia included hypertension, low income, and low education, while the risk of developing dementia is increased by obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the growing evidence regarding the epidemiological distribution and determinants of dementia worldwide, studies from the Arab region remain scarce. CONCLUSION: This systematic review highlights the need for population-based studies to provide necessary information for developing preventive and curative strategies specific to the Arab region.",2019,,Behav Neurol,2019,,3935943,,10.1155/2019/3935943,31772681,#416,El-Metwally 2019
Pubmed,Marriage and risk of dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,Sommerlad A; Ruegger J; Singh-Manoux A; Lewis G; Livingston G,"BACKGROUND: Being married is associated with healthier lifestyle behaviours and lower mortality and may reduce risk for dementia due to life-course factors. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of the association between marital status and the risk of developing dementia. METHODS: We searched medical databases and contacted experts in the field for relevant studies reporting the relationship, adjusted for age and sex, between marital status and dementia. We rated methodological quality and conducted random-effects meta-analyses to summarise relative risks of being widowed, divorced or lifelong single, compared with being married. Secondary stratified analyses with meta-regression examined the impact of clinical and social context and study methodology on findings. RESULTS: We included 15 studies with 812â€‰047 participants. Compared with those who are married, lifelong single (relative risk=1.42 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.90)) and widowed (1.20 (1.02 to 1.41)) people have elevated risk of dementia. We did not find an association in divorced people.Further analyses showed that less education partially confounds the risk in widowhood and worse physical health the elevated risk in lifelong single people. Compared with studies that used clinical registers for ascertaining dementia diagnoses, those which clinically examined all participants found higher risk for being unmarried. CONCLUSIONS: Being married is associated with reduced risk of dementia than widowed and lifelong single people, who are also underdiagnosed in routine clinical practice. Dementia prevention in unmarried people should focus on education and physical health and should consider the possible effect of social engagement as a modifiable risk factor.",2018,Mar,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,89,3,231-238,,10.1136/jnnp-2017-316274,29183957,#415,Sommerlad 2018
Pubmed,Secular Trends in Dementia Prevalence and Incidence Worldwide: A Systematic Review.,Stephan BCM; Birdi R; Tang EYH; Cosco TD; Donini LM; Licher S; Ikram MA; Siervo M; Robinson L,"BACKGROUND: Time trends for dementia prevalence and incidence rates have been reported over the past seven decades in different countries and some have reported a decline. OBJECTIVE: To undertake a systematic review to critically appraise and provide an evidence-based summary of the magnitude and direction of the global changes in dementia prevalence and incidence across time. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and PsychINFO were searched for studies focused on secular trends in dementia prevalence and/or incidence until 18 December 2017. In total, 10,992 articles were identified and 43 retained. RESULTS: Overall, prevalence rates are largely increasing (evidence primarily from record-based surveys and cohort studies in Japan, Canada, and France) or have remained stable (evidence primarily from cohort studies in Sweden, Spain and China). A significant decline in prevalence has however been reported in more recent studies (i.e., from 2010 onwards) from Europe (e.g., UK and Sweden) and the USA. Incidence rates have generally remained stable or decreased in China, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, UK, and USA. An increase has only been reported in five countries: Italy, Japan, Wales, Germany, and the Netherlands. Only one study reported findings (stability in incidence) from a low and middle-income country using data from Nigeria. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on secular trends in the prevalence and incidence of dementia is mixed including contradictory findings using different (and in some cases the same) datasets in some countries (e.g., the USA, UK, and Sweden). This making it difficult to draw concrete conclusions. However, declining trends recently observed in some high-income Western countries in the most recent two decades including the UK, USA, and Sweden are encouraging.

Pubmed,"Preventing delirium: should non-pharmacological, multicomponent interventions be used? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.",Martinez F; Tobar C; Hill N,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that is common among elderly inpatients. It has been associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, cognitive and functional decline and increased institutionalisation rates. Multicomponent interventions, a series of non-pharmacological strategies frequently handled by nursing staff, might be useful for prevention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of multicomponent interventions in preventing incident delirium in the elderly. METHODS: A systematic review of randomised trials was undertaken. Two independent reviewers performed iterative literature searches in seven databases without language restrictions. Grey literature repositories were considered as well. The quality of included trials was assessed by using the criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration. When possible, data were synthesised into a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Ï‡2 and I2 tests. FINDINGS: A total of 21,788 citations were screened, and seven studies of diverse quality were included in the review, comprising 1,691 participants. Multicomponent interventions significantly reduced incident delirium (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.85, P<0.001) and accidental falls during the hospitalisation (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21, 0.72, P=0.003), without evidence of differential effectiveness according to ward type or dementia rates. Non-significant reductions in delirium duration, hospital stay and mortality were found as well. INTERPRETATION: Multicomponent interventions are effective in preventing incident delirium among elderly inpatients. Effects seemed to be stable among different settings. Due to the limited amount of data, potential benefits in survival need to be confirmed in further studies. Future research should be aimed at contrasting different multicomponent programmes to select the most useful interventions.",2015,Mar,Age Ageing,44,2,196-204,,10.1093/ageing/afu173,25424450,#408,Martinez 2015
Pubmed,The efficacy and underlying mechanism of phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors in preventing cognitive impairment and Alzheimer pathology: A systematic review of animal studies.,El-Bakly W; Wagdy O; Sobhy A; Abo Elenain O; Riad MS; El Sayed M; Tarkhan S; Yassen M; Mahmoud A; Bassiony M; Nabil N,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) initially presents with cognitive decline that affects the affected individual's daily activities. Cognitive decline reversal represents an important medical need, where Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5Is) might play a role. AIM: This systematic review was performed to verify the efficacy of PDE-5Is in preventing cognitive impairment and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Preclinical animal studies assessing the efficacy of PDE-5Is in preventing cognitive impairment and pathological changes by measuring AÎ_-42 Î_42 and p-Tau were included in the analysis. CAMARADES Checklist was used to assess study quality. Further, various signaling pathways in different studies were examined. RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: Data of behavioral tests were extracted and a meta-analysis was conducted. Fifteen animal trials met the inclusion criteria, and all reported the prevention of cognitive deficits by PDE-5Is in Alzheimer's disease. A significant effect of PDE-5Is in increasing the time spent in the target quadrant was reported in four of seven studies using the water maze. Four studies showed significant improvement in contextual fear memory freezing time, and three studies showed improvement in the 14 unit maze number of errors. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline in preclinical AD finds tauopathy has a more impact than AÎ_-42. This systematic review showed that PDE-5 inhibitors might help prevent cognitive impairment in AD, and while its mechanism of action is non-related to AÎ_-42, it might include decrease p-Tau, increase CREB and BDNF or suppressing apoptosis and inflammation. However, the efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitors in preventing cognitive impairment remains unclear due to various limitations, such as the small number of included studies, the high risk of bias, the lack of an integrated study design, and low reporting quality.",2019,Oct,Behav Brain Res,372,,112004,,10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112004,31163203,#404,El-Bakly 2019
Pubmed,Longitudinal Effect of Stroke on Cognition: A Systematic Review.,Tang EY; Amiesimaka O; Harrison SL; Green E; Price C; Robinson L; Siervo M; Stephan BC,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is associated with an increased risk of dementia; however, the impact of stroke on cognition has been found to be variable, such that stroke survivors can show decline, remain stable, or revert to baseline cognitive functioning. Knowing the natural history of cognitive impairment after stroke is important for intervention. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the longitudinal course of cognitive function in stroke survivors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO) were searched using OvidSP from inception to July 15, 2016. Longitudinal studies with â‰¥2 time points of cognitive assessment after stroke were included. In total, 5952 articles were retrieved and 14 were included. There was a trend toward significant deterioration in cognitive test scores in stroke survivors (8 studies). Cognitive stability (3 studies) and improvement (3 studies) were also demonstrated, although follow-up time tended to be shorter in these studies. Variables associated with impairment included age, ethnicity, premorbid cognitive performance, depression, stroke location, and history of previous stroke. Associations with APOE*E4 (apolipoprotein E with the E4 allele) allele status and sex were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, but cognitive decline is not a consequence. Factors associated with decline, such as sociodemographic status, health-related comorbidity, stroke history, and clinical features could be used in models to predict future risk of dementia after stroke. A risk model approach could identify patients at greatest risk for timely intervention to reduce the frequency or delay the onset of poststroke cognitive impairment and dementia.",2018,Jan,J Am Heart Assoc,7,2,,,10.1161/JAHA.117.006443,29335318,#403,Tang 2018
Pubmed,Glucocerebrosidase mutations and neuropsychiatric phenotypes in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementias: Review and meta-analyses.,Creese B; Bell E; Johar I; Francis P; Ballard C; Aarsland D,"Heterozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) are a major genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Recently, there has been a considerable focus on the relationship between GBA mutations and emergence of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in these diseases. Here, we review the literature in this area, with a particular focus, including meta-analysis, on the key neuropsychiatric symptoms of cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression in Parkinson's disease. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that GBA mutations are associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment. In addition, our novel meta-analyses of psychosis and depression showed a 1.8- and 2.2-fold increased risk respectively associated with GBA mutations, although due to possible bias and heterogeneity the depression findings should be interpreted with caution. While the precise mechanisms which increase susceptibility to neurodegeneration in GBA carriers are not known, evidence of greater cortical Lewy body pathology, reduced patterns of cortical activation, and hippocampal pathology in animal models are all consistent with a direct effect of GBA mutations on these symptoms. Extension of this work in DLB and individuals without neurodegeneration will be important in further characterizing how GBA mutations increase risk for PD and DLB and influence disease course.",2018,Mar,Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,177,2,232-241,,10.1002/ajmg.b.32549,28548708,#402,Creese 2018

It is known that vascular risk factors play an important role in the development and progression of this condition. Alterations in vascular walls represent documented findings in patients with AD and other dementias affecting elderly people.

METHODS: We included 5 studies from the Uniform Neuro-Imaging of Virchow-Robin Space Enlargement (UNIVRSE) consortium, namely the Austrian Stroke Prevention Family Study, Study of Health in Pomerania, Rotterdam Study, Epidemiology of Dementia in Singapore study, and Risk Index for Subclinical Brain Lesions in Hong Kong study. ePVS were counted in 4 regions (mesencephalon, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and centrum semiovale) with harmonized rating across studies. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and general fluid cognitive ability factor (G-factor) were used to assess cognitive function. For each study, a linear regression model was performed to estimate the effect of ePVS on MMSE and G-factor. Estimates were pooled across studies with the use of inverse variance meta-analysis with fixed- or random-effect models when appropriate. RESULTS: The final sample size consisted of 3,575 persons (age range 63.4-73.2 years, 50.6% women). Total ePVS counts were not significantly associated with MMSE score (mean difference per ePVS score increase 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.007 to 0.008, p = 0.885) or G-factor (mean difference per ePVS score increase 0.002, 95% CI -0.001 to 0.006, p = 0.148) in age-, sex-, and education-adjusted models. Adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors and MRI markers did not change the results. Repeating the analyses with region-specific ePVS rendered similar results.

Pubmed,Cognitive screening instruments to identify vascular cognitive impairment: A systematic review.,Ghafar MZAA; Miptah HN; O'Caoimh R,"INTRODUCTION: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is common and important to detect as controlling risk factors, particularly hypertension, may slow onset and progression. There is no consensus as to which cognitive screening instrument (CSI) is most suitable for VCI. We systematically reviewed the psychometric properties of brief CSIs for vascular mild cognitive impairment (VMCI) and vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: Literature searches were performed using scholarly databases from inception until 31 May 2018. Studies were eligible if participants were aged 18 or older, interviewed face-to-face, and standard diagnostic criteria for VCI were applied, excluding those specifically identifying post-stroke dementia. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified including eight types of CSIs (27 subtests/variants) and 4575 participants (1015 with VCI), mean age range: 51.6 to 75.5Â years. Most studies compared more than one instrument. Five papers examined clock-drawing; four, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); and three used the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET). The MoCA (AUCÂ >Â 0.90) and MMSE (AUC: 0.86-0.99) had excellent accuracy in differentiating VaD from controls; the MoCA had good internal consistency (Cronbach's Î±: .83-.88). The MoCA (AUC: 0.87-0.93) and BMET (AUC: 0.94) had the greatest accuracy in separating VMCI from controls. Most studies had low to moderate risk of bias in all domains of the QUIPS. Data were heterogeneous, precluding a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although few studies were available and further research is required, data suggests that the MoCA is accurate and reliable for differentiating VaD and VMCI from controls.",2019,Aug,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,34,8,1114-1127,,10.1002/gps.5136,31050033,#390,GhafarMZAA 2019
Pubmed,Risk factors for sleep disturbances in older adults: Evidence from prospective studies.,Smagula SF; Stone KL; Fabio A; Cauley JA,"No systematic review of epidemiological evidence has examined risk factors for sleep disturbances among older adults. We searched the PubMed database combining search terms targeting the following domains 1) prospective, 2) sleep, and 3) aging, and identified 21 relevant population-based studies with prospective sleep outcome data. Only two studies utilized objective measures of sleep disturbance, while six used the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and thirteen used insomnia symptoms or other sleep complaints as the outcome measure. Female gender, depressed mood, and physical illness were most consistently identified as risks for future sleep disturbances. Less robust evidence implicated the following as potentially relevant predictors: lower physical activity levels, African-American race, lower economic status, previous manual occupation, widowhood, marital quality, loneliness and perceived stress, preclinical dementia, long-term benzodiazepine and sedative use, low testosterone levels, and inflammatory markers. Chronological age was not identified as a consistent, independent predictor of future sleep disturbances.

Yet, their chronic use is associated with cases of abuse, dependence, and relapse in many patients. Furthermore, elderly people are susceptible to alterations in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics as well as to drug interaction due to polypharmacy. These situations increase the risk for the appearance of cognitive affectations and the development of pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present work, there is a summary of some clinical studies that have evaluated the effect of BZDs and Z-drugs in the adult population with and without AD, focusing on the relationship between their use and the loss of cognitive function. Additionally, there is an assessment of preclinical studies focused on finding molecular proof on the pathways by which these drugs could be involved in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, available data (1990-2019) on BZD and Z-drug use among elderly patients, with and without AD, was compiled in this work. Finally, the relationship between the use of BZD and Z-drugs for the treatment of insomnia and the appearance of AD biomarkers was analyzed. Results pointed to a vicious circle that would worsen the condition of patients over time. Likewise, it put into relevance the need for close monitoring of those patients using BZDs that also suffer from AD. Consequently, future studies should focus on optimizing strategies for insomnia treatment in the elderly by using other substances like melatonin agonists, which is described to have a much more significant safety profile.",2019,,Front Aging Neurosci,11,,344,,10.3389/fnagi.2019.00344,31969812,#387,Ettcheto 2019
Pubmed,"Periodontal disease, tooth loss and dementia: Is there a link? A systematic review.",Tonsekar PP; Jiang SS; Yue G,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that dementia is caused by neuronal damage due to chronic inflammation from peripheral sources such as the oral cavity in periodontal disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our review was to assess the risk of dementia or cognitive impairment associated with chronic periodontitis and multiple tooth loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive search of electronic databases of articles on the relation between periodontitis, tooth loss and dementia published on or before April 2016 was conducted. Experimental and human studies that provided a description consistent with multiple tooth loss, chronic periodontal disease and cognitive impairment obtained by validated methods were selected. The data extracted from the articles included study design, country of origin, sample size, methods used to assess periodontitis and cognition, average age at the baseline and number of years of follow-up. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of human studies. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 756 articles which were independently screened, and 16 articles were included in the review. Four human studies reported an association of subsequent dementia with multiple tooth loss. One human study reported that chronic periodontal disease was associated with dementia. Eight experimental studies demonstrated an association between cognitive impairment and tooth loss. CONCLUSION: The literature on chronic periodontitis and multiple tooth loss as risk factors to dementia remains inconclusive. More randomised clinical trials on the association between periodontitis and dementia with uniform criteria for evaluation and diagnosis of periodontitis are warranted.",2017,Jun,Gerodontology,34,2,151-163,,10.1111/ger.12261,28168759,#385,Tonsekar 2017
Pubmed,Orthostatic hypotension and symptomatic subclinical orthostatic hypotension increase risk of cognitive impairment: an integrated evidence review and analysis of a large older adult hypertensive cohort.,Peters R; Anstey KJ; Booth A; Beckett N; Warwick J; Antikainen R; Rockwood K; Peters J; Bulpitt CJ,"AIMS: Systematically reviewing the literature found orthostatic hypotension (OH) to be associated with an increased risk of incident dementia but limited data were available in those at highest risk, the hypertensive oldest-old. Our aim was to analyse the relationship between OH and incident cognitive decline or dementia in this group and to synthesize the evidence base overall. METHOD AND RESULTS: Participants aged â‰¥80â€‰years, with hypertension, were from the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) cohort. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a fall of â‰¥15â€‰mmHg in systolic and or â‰¥7â€‰mmHg in diastolic pressure after 2 min standing from a sitting position. Subclinical orthostatic hypotension with symptoms (SOH) was defined as a fall <OH but with unsteadiness, light-headedness, or faintness in the week before blood pressure measurement. Proportional hazard regression was used to examine the relationship between baseline OH, SOH, and cognitive outcomes. There were 3121 in the analytical sample, 538 with OH. Orthostatic hypotension was associated with increased risk of cognitive decline (906 events), hazard ratio (HR) 1.36 (95% confidence interval 1.14-1.59). For incident dementia (241 events), HR 1.34 (0.98-1.84). When competing risk of cardiovascular events were taken into account results were HR 1.39 (1.19-1.62) and HR 1.34 (1.05-1.73), respectively. Subclinical orthostatic hypotension was associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline HR 1.56 (1.12-2.17) and dementia HR 1.79 (1.00-3.20). Combining the results from the HYVET cohort in a meta-analysis with the existing published literature in this area found a 21% (9-35%) increased risk of dementia with OH. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic hypotension indicates an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline. SOH may also be considered a risk factor, at least in older hypertensive adults. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and whether interventions to reduce impact of OH could protect cognition.",2018,Sep,Eur Heart J,39,33,3135-3143,,10.1093/eurheartj/ehy418,30052878,#384,Peters 2018

Recent reviews indicate that depressive symptoms predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, but results need to be further explored. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of depressive symptoms on the development of dementia in people with MCI, and explore potential sources of between-study variability, including study setting by a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Databases were searched for prospective studies defining people with MCI at baseline, investigating dementia at follow-up and giving information about depressive symptoms. Two authors independently extracted data from the studies and rated the methodological quality. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effect models to yield pooled risk ratios (RR). Meta-regression analyses tested differences between clinical and community-based studies and other sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies, representing 14,158 individuals with MCI, were included in the meta-analysis. Depressive symptoms in MCI predicted dementia in 15 community-based studies (RRâ€_=â€_1.69, 95% CI 1.49-1.93, I2â€_=â€_0.0%), but not in 20 clinical studies (RRâ€_=â€_1.02, 95% CI 0.92-1.14, I2â€_=â€_73.0%). Further investigation of this effect showed that the mean age of community-based studies was significantly higher than of clinical studies but neither this nor other study characteristics explained variability in study outcomes.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to summarize and clarify the association between TREM2 variants and AD, and examined the relationship between TREM2 genetic variant and the etiology of AD. Relevant case-control studies were retrieved and collected according to established inclusion criteria. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to estimate the associations between three TREM2 variants (rs75932628, rs104894002, and rs143332484) and AD. In overall meta-analysis, the summary ORs for rs75932628, rs104894002, and rs143332484 were 2.70 [95% CI: 2.24, 3.24; P < 0.001], 7.21 (95% CI: 1.28, 40.78; P = 0.025), and 1.65 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.21; P = 0.001), respectively, indicating that the TREM2 rs75932628, rs104894002, and rs143332484 may contribute to AD risk. However, sensitivity analysis showed that the results of rs104894002 and rs143332484 should be interpreted with caution, and larger sample size, particularly in different ethnicities, are needed to validate the two variants. The current meta-analysis demonstrates that TREM2 is a candidate gene for AD susceptibility, and TREM2 variant rs75932628 may be a risk factor for AD.",2015,Oct,Neurol Sci,36,10,1881-8,,10.1007/s10072-015-2274-2,26037549,#380,Lu 2015

This study investigated associations between risk factors and late-life cognitive decline on a global scale, including comparisons between ethno-regional groups. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We harmonized longitudinal data from 20 population-based cohorts from 15 countries over 5 continents, including 48,522 individuals (58.4% women) aged 54-105 (mean = 72.7) years and without dementia at baseline. Studies had 2-15 years of follow-up. The risk factors investigated were age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, anxiety, apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele (APOE*4) status, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure and pulse pressure, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, self-rated health, high cholesterol, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, physical activity, smoking, and history of stroke. Associations with risk factors were determined for a global cognitive composite outcome (memory, language, processing speed, and executive functioning tests) and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Individual participant data meta-analyses of multivariable linear mixed model results pooled across cohorts revealed that for at least 1 cognitive outcome, age (B = -0.1, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.31, SE = 0.11), depression (B = -0.11, SE = 0.06), diabetes (B = -0.23, SE = 0.10), current smoking (B = -0.20, SE = 0.08), and history of stroke (B = -0.22, SE = 0.09) were independently associated with poorer cognitive performance (p < 0.05 for all), and higher levels of education (B = 0.12, SE = 0.02) and vigorous physical activity (B = 0.17, SE = 0.06) were associated with better performance (p < 0.01 for both). Age (B = -0.07, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.41, SE = 0.18), and diabetes (B = -0.18, SE = 0.10) were independently associated with faster cognitive decline (p < 0.05 for all). Different effects between Asian people and white people included stronger associations for Asian people between ever smoking and poorer cognition (group by risk factor interaction: B = -0.24, SE = 0.12), and between diabetes and cognitive decline (B = -0.66, SE = 0.27; p < 0.05 for both). Limitations of our study include a loss or distortion of risk factor data with harmonization, and not investigating factors at midlife. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that education, smoking, physical activity, diabetes, and stroke are all modifiable factors associated with cognitive decline. If these factors are determined to be causal, controlling them could minimize worldwide levels of cognitive decline. However, any global prevention strategy may need to consider ethno-regional differences.",2019,Jul,PLoS Med,16,7,e1002853,,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002853,31335910,#375,Lipnicki 2019
Pubmed,Homocysteine and Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence for a Causal Link from Mendelian Randomization.,Hu Q; Teng W; Li J; Hao F; Wang N,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The relationship between plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been studied for many years, but remains controversial. While a recent meta-analysis of epidemiological studies, which included observational studies, indicated that homocysteine may be a risk factor for AD, there remains a need to further demonstrate this link due to the large degree of heterogeneity between studies. Epidemiological studies have certain limitations, as their results can be affected by confounding factors and reverse causation. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between plasma homocysteine and AD by using a Mendelian randomization method to avoid problems of confounding bias and reverse causality. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for reports regarding the MTHFR C677T polymorphism (rs1801133) from the time of their inception to September 2015. These reports were combined with related observational studies, and used to evaluate the effect of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) on the risk for AD. A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies had previously suggested a relationship between homocysteine and MTHFR C677T (rs 1801133).

Pubmed,The preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite: measuring amyloid-related decline.,Donohue MC; Sperling RA; Salmon DP; Rentz DM; Raman R; Thomas RG; Weiner M; Aisen PS,"IMPORTANCE: As Alzheimer disease (AD) research moves to intervene in presymptomatic phases of the disease, we must develop outcome measures sensitive to the earliest disease-related changes. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the 2 studies that collected data on AÎ_ levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD ""AÎ_-positive"" placebo group and compare them with an ""AÎ_-negative"" group. For the study that did not include data on AÎ_ levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-Îµ4 and by clinical progression. RESULTS: In ADNI, AÎ_-positive participants showed more decline than did AÎ_-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95% CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02). In AIBL, the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95% CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95% CI, -2.290 to -0.519]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-Îµ4 allele carriers performed significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 [0.294] [95% CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95% CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95% CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001).

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a quantitative systematic review and meta-analyses on the impact of a hospitalization on readmission, institutionalization, and mortality in PwD. To identify factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, CENTRAL, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies including terms for dementia, hospital, readmission, institutionalization, and mortality. Relevant were assessed by a quality criteria sheet. Results were summarized in a table. Meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3.

Pubmed,Risk of prevalent and incident dementia associated with insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3.,Almeida OP; Hankey GJ; Yeap BB; Paul Chubb SA; Gollege J; Flicker L,"Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) influences cell proliferation and survival. In the extracellular environment, IGF-1 circulates bound to proteins (IGF-binding proteins; IGFBP), some of which have physiological effects that seem independent of IGF-1, including the brain (for example, IGFBP-3). We completed a systematic review of the association between dementia and IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, and a cross-sectional and longitudinal study designed to investigate if lower plasma concentration of these proteins increased the risk of prevalent and incident dementia. A total of 3967 men aged 71-89 years joined the study, of whom 535 (13.5%) showed evidence of prevalent cognitive impairment. The plasma concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were similar for men with and without cognitive impairment. The 3432 men free of cognitive impairment were then followed for up to 13 years. During this time 571 (16.6%) developed dementia. The plasma concentration of IGF-1 had no association with incident dementia. The doubling of the plasma concentration of IGFBP-3 decreased the hazard ratio of dementia by 23% (95% confidence interval=5-37%). The results were not affected by age, body mass index and history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease or stroke.

Pubmed,Meta-analysis of Telomere Length in Alzheimer's Disease.,Forero DA; GonzÃ¡lez-Giraldo Y; LÃ_pez-Quintero C; Castro-Vega LJ; Barreto GE; Perry G,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and severe neurodegenerative disorder. Human telomeres are fundamental for the maintenance of genomic stability and play prominent roles in both cellular senescence and organismal aging. Regulation of telomere length (TL) is the result of the complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. Alterations in TL are increasingly being studied as a possible risk factor for AD, and published studies on TL in AD show discrepant results, highlighting the need for a meta-analysis. METHODS: In the current study, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of TL in AD patients and healthy controls. PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases (from inception to September 2015) were used to identify relevant articles reporting TL in humans with AD, from which we retrieved data such as sample size, experimental methods, and mean TL for cases and controls. A random-effects model was used for meta-analytical procedures. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 13 primary studies and demonstrated a significant difference in TL between 860 AD patients and 2,022 controls, with a standardized mean difference of -0.984 (confidence interval: -1.433 to -0.535; p value: <.001).

Pubmed,Hypercortisolemia and glucocorticoid receptor-signaling insufficiency in Alzheimer's disease initiation and development.,Notarianni E,"The cause and mechanism of development of Alzheimer' s disease (AD) remain unexplained. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, denoted by adrenal cortisol hypersecretion, is a recognised feature of the condition but generally disregarded as causative, due to lack of association between AD and other hypercortisolemic states. However, a meta-analysis of published studies suggests a need for reappraisal. A specific circadian rhythm of cortisol hypersecretion pertains at mild-to-moderate AD stages, entailing increased levels at the circadian peak from a low nadir. This is in contrast to the continuously elevated levels that are characteristic of other hypercortisolemic states, e.g. Cushing' s disease or major depression. This previously overlooked detail provides a starting premise here: that equating the form of hypercortisolism in AD with that in other states is inappropriate, as phasic and chronic elevation elicit different neuroendocrine effects. Theoretical implications are discussed in this review. Given the capacity of glucocorticoids and corticotropin-releasing hormone to induce AD-associated pathologies, I suggest a role for circadian cortisol hypersecretion in the initiation of sporadic AD; and propose a temporal mechanism for AD development featuring neuroinflammation- mediated suppression of central glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. This latter may represent a critical phase in AD development, where the density of functional GR is proposed to underlie the ""cognitive reserve"". Supporting evidence for this mechanism is drawn from the brain regional locations of AD neuropathologies, and from risk factors for AD development (aging, ApoE-4 genotype, and hypertension). Thus, it is argued that basal hypercortisolemia merits further scrutiny regarding AD causation and development.",2013,Sep,Curr Alzheimer Res,10,7,714-31,,10.2174/15672050113109990137,23906001,#360,Notarianni 2013
Pubmed,Sex Differences in Depression as a Risk Factor for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,Underwood EA; Davidson HP; Azam AB; Tierney MC,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depression is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) but little is known about the mechanisms of this association. Given sex differences in both AD and depression, we sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether there are sex differences in their association, as this may improve understanding of underlying mechanisms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Reviews were searched for observational studies including both sexes and examining the association between history of depression and AD. RESULTS: Forty studies, including 62,729 women and 47,342 men, were identified. Meta-analysis was not possible because only 3 studies provided sufficient data. Seven studies provided information about the influence of sex for a qualitative synthesis. Two found an association in men only, 2 in women only, and 3 reported no sex differences. The 2 studies finding an association in women only were unique in that they had the shortest follow-up periods, and were the only clinic-based studies. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings of our systematic review show that there are important methodological differences among the few studies providing data on the influence of sex on depression as a risk factor for AD. Had all 40 studies provided sex-segregated data, these methodological differences and their impact on sex effects could have been examined quantitatively. We encourage researchers to report these data, as well as potential moderating factors, so that the role of sex differences can be better understood.",2019,May,Innov Aging,3,2,igz015,,10.1093/geroni/igz015,31276050,#358,Underwood 2019
Pubmed,Association between osteoarthritis and increased risk of dementia: A systemic review and meta-analysis.,Weber A; Mak SH; Berenbaum F; Sellam J; Zheng YP; Han Y; Wen C,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible association between osteoarthritis (OA) and the risk of dementia. METHODS: Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies were obtained from wide literature search up to 20 April 2018 from following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, using the MeSH terms: ""osteoarthritis"" AND ""dementia"". The literature search was then expanded to congress abstracts. After screening and selection of relevant studies by two investigators, data was extracted. Estimates were then calculated using a random-effect size model. Sensitivity-analysis was conducted for gender and age adjusted studies and pooled for studies with STROBE quality assessment score â‰¥75%. Publication bias was assessed by Funnel plot. Analyses were performed using Data Analysis and Statistical Software Version 14.2. RESULTS: Nearly 1549 publication references were initially retrieved. Twenty-six publications were checked with full-text. Six observational studies with 388,252 individuals were included. OA was associated with a significantly increased risk for dementia (ORâ€_=â€_1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.39, Iâ€_=â€_95.6%, Pâ€_<â€_.05). After pooling the studies with adjustment of age and gender, the risk increased (OR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22-1.51, Iâ€_=â€_75.6%, Pâ€_<â€_.0001). After pooling the study with a STROBE Quality score â‰¥75% the risk for dementia was slightly increased (OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.17-1.5, Iâ€_=â€_93.5%, pâ€_<â€_0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between osteoarthritis and the risk of dementia. This meta-analysis does not provide causality. Further prospective cohort studies are needed to clarify, if knee-, hip-, or hand-OA are independent risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.",2019,Mar,Medicine (Baltimore),98,10,e14355,,10.1097/MD.0000000000014355,30855434,#355,Weber 2019
Pubmed,Association of microtubule-associated protein tau gene polymorphisms with the risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.,Yuan H; Du L; Ge P; Wang X; Xia Q,"BACKGROUND: Numerous epidemiological studies were published to investigate the role of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene variations (rs7521G/A, rs242557G/A, rs1467967A/G, rs2471738C/T and rs3785883G/A) in SAD, and these genetic polymorphisms may be a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). However, controversial results were revealed. METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase and HuGEnet databases were searched to identify eligible studies. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the genetic association of MAPT with the risk of SAD. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies were included in this meta-analysis to assess the association between five single-nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to SAD. The pooled results exhibited no significant association between rs1467967A/G, rs3785883G/A, rs2471738C/T and rs7521G/A polymorphisms and the risk of SAD. However, a lower risk of SAD was observed in the GG versus (GA + AA) model of rs242557G/A polymorphism (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.751-0.983, P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis showed that rs1467967A/G, rs3785883G/A, rs2471738C/T and rs7521G/A polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of SAD. However, rs242557G/A genetic polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to SAD, and individuals with a GG genotype of rs242557G/A might be at a lower risk of SAD. Further studies with a larger sample size are required to validate these conclusions.",2018,Jun,Int J Neurosci,128,6,577-585,,10.1080/00207454.2017.1400972,29098924,#352,Yuan 2018
Pubmed,Impact of obstructive sleep apnea on silent cerebral small vessel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Chokesuwattanaskul A; Lertjitbanjong P; Thongprayoon C; Bathini T; Sharma K; Mao MA; Cheungpasitporn W; Chokesuwattanaskul R,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a well-known cause of vascular dementia, a leading medical morbidity in the aging population. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been validated as a cardiovascular risk factor. However, the relationship between these two clinical syndromes is not well established. We aimed to assess the association between OSA and CSVD. METHODS: Databases were searched from inception through May 2019. Studies that reported incidence or odd ratios of CSVD in patients with OSA were included. Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. RESULTS: A total of 14 observational studies comprising of 4335 patients were included into the analysis. Compared to patients without OSA, patients with OSA were significantly associated with CSVD magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and asymptomatic lacunar infarction (ALI) with a pooled OR of 2.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-3.66, I(2)Â =Â 79%) and 1.78 (95% CI, 1.06-3.01, I(2)Â =Â 41%), respectively. However, there was no significant association between OSA and findings of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 2.15 (95% CI, 0.64-7.29, I(2)Â =Â 55%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the association between OSA and CSVD MRI findings of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and asymptomatic lacunar infarction (ALI) when compared to patients without OSA. The absence of an association of CMBs findings with OSA could be due either by a lower sensitivity of neuroimaging techniques utilized to detect CMBs or a potentially different pathogenesis of CMBs.",2020,Apr,Sleep Med,68,,80-88,,10.1016/j.sleep.2019.11.1262,32028230,#348,Chokesuwattanaskul 2020
Pubmed,Association between interleukin-6 -174G/C polymorphism and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.,Hua Y; Guo X; Huang Q; Kong Y; Lu X,"BACKGROUND: The -174G/C polymorphism in interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene has been extensively investigated for association to Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, results of different studies have been inconsistent. The objective of this study is to assess the relationship of IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by using meta-analysis. METHODS: All eligible case-control studies were searched in PubMed and EMBASE. Odds ratios (ORs) with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association. RESULTS: A total of 5316 cases and 10 757 controls in 21 case-control studies were included. Obvious heterogeneity among studies was detected, and no significant association was observed between the IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism and AD risk. After exclusion of three studies, the heterogeneity disappeared and significant association was observed between the polymorphism and AD risk in Asians (CC vs. CG+GG: OR = 0.5; 95%CI, 0.33-0.75) but not in Caucasians. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that the -174G/C polymorphism of IL-6 gene would be a protective risk factor for AD in Asians.

Pubmed,Hospitalisation rates and predictors in people with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Shepherd H; Livingston G; Chan J; Sommerlad A,"BACKGROUND: Hospitalisation is often harmful for people with dementia and results in high societal costs, so avoidance of unnecessary admissions is a global priority. However, no intervention has yet reduced admissions of community-dwelling people with dementia. We therefore aimed to examine hospitalisation rates of people with dementia and whether these differ from people without dementia and to identify socio-demographic and clinical predictors of hospitalisation. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to 9 May 2019. We included observational studies which (1) examined community-dwelling people with dementia of any age or dementia subtype, (2) diagnosed dementia using validated diagnostic criteria, and (3) examined all-cause general (i.e. non-psychiatric) hospital admissions. Two authors screened abstracts for inclusion and independently extracted data and assessed included studies for risk of bias. Three authors graded evidence strength using Cochrane's GRADE approach, including assessing for evidence of publication bias using Begg's test. We used random effects meta-analysis to pool estimates for hospitalisation risk in people with and without dementia. RESULTS: We included 34 studies of 277,432 people with dementia: 17 from the USA, 15 from Europe, and 2 from Asia. The pooled relative risk of hospitalisation for people with dementia compared to those without was 1.42 (95% confidence interval 1.21, 1.66) in studies adjusted for age, sex, and physical comorbidity. Hospitalisation rates in people with dementia were between 0.37 and 1.26/person-year in high-quality studies. There was strong evidence that admission is associated with older age, and moderately strong evidence that multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and lower functional ability are associated with admission. There was strong evidence that dementia severity alone is not associated. CONCLUSIONS: People with dementia are more frequently admitted to hospital than those without dementia, independent of physical comorbidities. Future interventions to reduce unnecessary hospitalisations should target potentially modifiable factors, such as polypharmacy and functional ability, in high-risk populations.",2019,Jul,BMC Med,17,1,130,,10.1186/s12916-019-1369-7,31303173,#346,Shepherd 2019
Pubmed,Depression and Antidepressants as Potential Risk Factors in Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 18 Longitudinal Studies.,Chan JYC; Yiu KKL; Kwok TCY; Wong SYS; Tsoi KKF,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether depression and/or antidepressants can be a potential risk factor for the development of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Community or clinical settings. Participants included patients with depression, antidepressant users, and the general population. MEASURES: Longitudinal studies evaluating the risks of dementia or MCI in patients with depression and/or antidepressant users were identified from the OVID database. The outcomes were the number of patients who developed dementia or MCI among the antidepressant users and nonusers. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to evaluate the association between the use of antidepressants and the risk of dementia and MCI. Meta-analysis was used for combining the effect sizes of individual studies, and the heterogeneity test was performed. Risk of bias and reporting quality of included studies was assessed. Subgroup analyses were conducted for different types of antidepressants. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies with 2,119,627 participants with mean age ranging from 55 to 81Â years were included. Among patients with depression, antidepressant users showed a significantly higher risk of dementia (RRÂ =Â 1.37, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.11-1.70) and MCI (RRÂ =Â 1.20, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.02-1.42) than the nonusers.

Pubmed,Respiratory Disease and Lower Pulmonary Function as Risk Factors for Dementia: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis.,Russ TC; KivimÃ_ki M; Batty GD,"BACKGROUND: In addition to affecting the oxygen supply to the brain, pulmonary function is a marker of multiple insults throughout life (including smoking, illness, and socioeconomic deprivation). In this meta-analysis of existing longitudinal studies, the hypothesis that lower pulmonary function and respiratory illness are linked to an elevated risk of dementia was tested. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of longitudinal studies using PubMed until April 1, 2019, and, where possible, results were pooled in random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Ten studies relating pulmonary function to later dementia risk and 11 studies of respiratory illness and dementia (including one that assessed both factors) were identified. The lowest quartile of FEV(1) compared with the highest was associated with a 1.4-fold (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95%Â CI, 0.77-2.75) increased dementia risk (N(total)Â = 62,209; two studies). AÂ decrease of 1 SD in FEV(1) was associated with a 28%Â increase in dementia risk (HR, 1.28; 95%Â CI, 1.03-1.60; N(total)Â = 67,505; six studies). Respiratory illness was also associated with increased dementia risk to a similar degree (pooled HR, 1.54; 95%Â CI, 1.30-1.81; N(total)Â = 288,641; 11 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with poor pulmonary function experience an increased risk of dementia.

Pubmed,A Systematic Review of Reminiscence Therapy for Older Adults in Taiwan.,Yen HY; Lin LJ,"BACKGROUND: Population aging is an increasing phenomenon in many countries around the world. It has been estimated that more than one quarter of all older adults experience a mental or neurological disorder or disease such as dementia, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Reminiscence is a popular treatment for enhancing well-being in older adults. Previous studies have shown that reminiscence therapy improves the cognitive functions, behaviors, and other psychosocial outcomes in older adult patients. The themes and materials that are used in reminiscence treatments for the older adults in Taiwan differ from those used in other countries because of Taiwan's unique historical background and culture. PURPOSE: The main purpose of the current study was to review systematically the application and outcomes of reminiscence therapy in Taiwan. METHOD: The terms ""reminiscence,"" ""dementia,"" ""Alzheimer's disease,"" and ""Taiwan"" were used in an Integrated Resources Search that was conducted at National Taiwan Normal University. Sixteen articles were systematically reviewed using a synthesis of two matrices of experimental designs and intervention designs. RESULT: Reminiscence group sizes ranged between 7 and 12 participants, session frequencies were all once a week for periods lasting between 4 and 16 weeks, and session durations ranged from 30 minutes to 2 hours. The memories of the participants were stimulated using materials dating from their youth such as Taiwanese folk songs, toys, photos, radio programs, newspapers, and food and drinks. In terms of research methodology, most of the studies that were reviewed used quasi-experimental designs without random assignment or control group due to sample size. A minority of the reviewed studies applied the randomized controlled treatment method. Only a few of the studies evaluated indicators in pretest, posttest, and follow-up periods. The results of these studies identified several benefits of reminiscence therapy in Taiwanese older adults, including improvements in cognitive function, anxiety, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and personal interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Reminiscence is a good noninvasive treatment for the prevention and treatment of mental diseases in Taiwanese older adults. Furthermore, reminiscence promotes mental health in older adults. Finally, this study provides recommendations for further study and clinical application of reminiscence therapy in Taiwan.",2018,Apr,J Nurs Res,26,2,138-150,,10.1097/jnr.0000000000000233,29016468,#342,Yen 2018

OBJECTIVE: To establish whether GBA1 mutations are a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). DESIGN We compared genotype data on patients and controls from 11 centers. Data concerning demographics, age at onset, disease duration, and clinical and pathological features were collected when available. We conducted pooled analyses using logistic regression to investigate GBA1 mutation carrier status as predicting DLB or PD with dementia status, using common control subjects as a reference group. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to account for additional heterogeneity. SETTING: Eleven centers from sites around the world performing genotyping. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred twenty-one cases met diagnostic criteria for DLB and 151 had PD with dementia. We compared these cases with 1962 controls from the same centers matched for age, sex, and ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of GBA1 mutations in cases and controls. RESULTS We found a significant association between GBA1 mutation carrier status and DLB, with an odds ratio of 8.28 (95% CI, 4.78-14.88). The odds ratio for PD with dementia was 6.48 (95% CI, 2.53-15.37). The mean age at diagnosis of DLB was earlier in GBA1 mutation carriers than in noncarriers (63.5 vs 68.9 years; P < .001), with higher disease severity scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mutations in GBA1 are a significant risk factor for DLB. GBA1 mutations likely play an even larger role in the genetic etiology of DLB than in PD, providing insight into the role of glucocerebrosidase in Lewy body disease.",2013,Jun,JAMA Neurol,70,6,727-35,,10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.1925,23588557,#336,Nalls 2013
Pubmed,Understanding the training and education needs of homecare workers supporting people with dementia and cancer: A systematic review of reviews.,Cunningham N; Cowie J; Watchman K; Methven K,"Many people with dementia, supported by family carers, prefer to live at home and may rely on homecare support services. People with dementia are also often living with multimorbidities, including cancer. The main risk factor for both cancer and dementia is age and the number of people living with dementia and cancer likely to rise. Upskilling the social care workforce to facilitate more complex care is central to national workforce strategies and challenges. Training and education development must also respond to the key requirements of a homecare workforce experiencing financial, recruitment and retention difficulties. This systematic review of reviews provides an overview of dementia and cancer training and education accessible to the homecare workforce. Findings reveal there is a diverse range of training and education available, with mixed evidence of effectiveness. Key barriers and facilitators to effective training and education are identified in order to inform future training, education and learning development for the homecare workforce supporting people with dementia and cancer.",2019,Jul,Dementia (London),,,1.47E+15,,10.1177/1471301219859781,31271044,#332,Cunningham 2019
Pubmed,Risk factors for the onset and progression of Huntington disease.,Chao TK; Hu J; Pringsheim T,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea, behavioural and psychiatric manifestations, and dementia, caused by a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the risk factors for the onset and progression of HD. Multiple databases were searched, using terms specific to Huntington disease and to studies of aetiology, risk, prevention and genetics, limited to studies on human subjects published in English or French between 1950 and 2010. Two reviewers independently screened the abstracts and identified potentially relevant articles for full-text review using predetermined inclusion criteria. Three major categories of risk factors for onset of HD were identified: CAG repeat length in the huntingtin gene, CAG instability, and genetic modifiers. Of these, CAG repeat length in the huntingtin gene is the most important risk factor. For the progression of HD: genetic, demographic, past medical/clinical and environmental risk factors have been studied. Of these factors, genetic factors appear to play the most important role in the progression of HD. Among the potential risk factors, CAG repeat length in the mutant allele was found to be a relatively consistent and significant risk factor for the progression of HD, especially in motor, cognitive, and other neurological symptom deterioration. In addition, there were many consistent results in the literature indicating that a higher number of CAG repeats was associated with shorter survival, faster institutionalization, and earlier percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.",2017,Jul,Neurotoxicology,61,,79-99,,10.1016/j.neuro.2017.01.005,28111121,#331,Chao 2017
Pubmed,A Systematic Review of Interventions to Change Staff Care Practices in Order to Improve Resident Outcomes in Nursing Homes.,Low LF; Fletcher J; Goodenough B; Jeon YH; Etherton-Beer C; MacAndrew M; Beattie E,"BACKGROUND: We systematically reviewed interventions that attempted to change staff practice to improve long-term care resident outcomes. METHODS: Studies met criteria if they used a control group, included 6 or more nursing home units and quantitatively assessed staff behavior or resident outcomes. Intervention components were coded as including education material, training, audit and feedback, monitoring, champions, team meetings, policy or procedures and organizational restructure. RESULTS: Sixty-three unique studies were broadly grouped according to clinical domain-oral health (3 studies), hygiene and infection control (3 studies), nutrition (2 studies), nursing home acquired pneumonia (2 studies), depression (2 studies) appropriate prescribing (7 studies), reduction of physical restraints (3 studies), management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (6 studies), falls reduction and prevention (11 studies), quality improvement (9 studies), philosophy of care (10 studies) and other (5 studies). No single intervention component, combination of, or increased number of components was associated with greater likelihood of positive outcomes. Studies with positive outcomes for residents also tended to change staff behavior, however changing staff behavior did not necessarily improve resident outcomes. Studies targeting specific care tasks (e.g. oral care, physical restraints) were more likely to produce positive outcomes than those requiring global practice changes (e.g. care philosophy). Studies using intervention theories were more likely to be successful. Program logic was rarely articulated, so it was often unclear whether there was a coherent connection between the intervention components and measured outcomes. Many studies reported barriers relating to staff (e.g. turnover, high workload, attitudes) or organizational factors (e.g. funding, resources, logistics). CONCLUSION: Changing staff practice in nursing homes is possible but complex. Interventionists should consider barriers and feasibility of program components to impact on each intended outcome.",2015,,PLoS One,10,11,e0140711,,10.1371/journal.pone.0140711,26559675,#330,Low 2015
Pubmed,Mapping the knowledge structure of frailty in journal articles by text network analysis.,Kim Y; Jang SN,"BACKGROUNDS: This study was to understand the trends of frailty research and networking features of keywords from the academic articles focusing on frailty in the last four decades. METHOD: Keywords were extracted from articles (n = 6,424) retrieved from Web of Science, from 1981 to April 2016, using Bibexcel, and a social network analysis was conducted using Net Miner. RESULTS: The core-keywords of research on frailty are constantly changing over the last 40 years. The keywords were tended to focus on impact in the 1980s, and moved to the determinants (i.e., malnutrition) in the 1990s and the 2000s, and in the 2010s, most of keywords were about determinants and measurement of frailty. In the early stages of frailty research, individual behaviour modifications were emphasized as intervention. Keywords with the highest degree centralities were 'impact' (1980s), 'frailty' (1990s), 'home care' (2000s), and 'dementia' (2010s). Keywords with the highest betweenness centralities were 'model' (1980s), 'frailty' (1990s), 'chronic disease' (2000s), and 'malnutrition' (2010s). DISCUSSION: This study provides a systematic overview of frailty knowledge development. 'Dementia' was found to be the keyword with the highest degree centrality, showing that studies on cognitive function are those being most actively conducted in recent decade. In the 2000s frailty research, sub-themes were sarcopenia, dementia and disability, indicating that frailty was investigated from the view of disease. In the 2010s, obesity, nutrition, prevention, evaluation, and ADL (activities of daily living) were sub-themes of the research network that focused on frailty prevention.",2018,,PLoS One,13,4,e0196104,,10.1371/journal.pone.0196104,29672647,#329,Kim 2018
Pubmed,Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Sommer I; Griebler U; Kien C; Auer S; Klerings I; Hammer R; Holzer P; Gartlehner G,"BACKGROUND: Sunlight exposure and high vitamin D status have been hypothesised to reduce the risk of developing dementia. The objective of our research was to determine whether lack of sunlight and hypovitaminosis D over time are associated with dementia. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ICONDA, and reference lists of pertinent review articles from 1990 to October 2015. We conducted random effects meta-analyses of published and unpublished data to evaluate the influence of sunlight exposure or vitamin D as a surrogate marker on dementia risk. RESULTS: We could not identify a single study investigating the association between sunlight exposure and dementia risk. Six cohort studies provided data on the effect of serum vitamin D concentration on dementia risk. A meta-analysis of five studies showed a higher risk for persons with serious vitamin D deficiency (<25Â nmol/L or 7-28Â nmol/L) compared to persons with sufficient vitamin D supply (â‰¥50Â nmol/L or 54-159Â nmol/L) (point estimate 1.54; 95% CI 1.19-1.99, I(2)â€‰=â€‰20%). The strength of evidence that serious vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing dementia, however, is very low due to the observational nature of included studies and their lack of adjustment for residual or important confounders (e.g. ApoE Îµ4 genotype), as well as the indirect relationship between Vitamin D concentrations as a surrogate for sunlight exposure and dementia risk. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review show that low vitamin D levels might contribute to the development of dementia. Further research examining the direct and indirect relationship between sunlight exposure and dementia risk is needed. Such research should involve large-scale cohort studies with homogeneous and repeated assessment of vitamin D concentrations or sunlight exposure and dementia outcomes.",2017,Jan,BMC Geriatr,17,1,16,,10.1186/s12877-016-0405-0,28086755,#328,Sommer 2017
Pubmed,Early Life Epidemiology of Alzheimer's Disease--A Critical Review.,Seifan A; Schelke M; Obeng-Aduasare Y; Isaacson R,"BACKGROUND: As adult brain structure is primarily established in early life, genetic and environmental exposures in infancy and childhood influence the risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). In this systematic review, we identified several early life risk factors and discussed the evidence and underlying mechanism for each. SUMMARY: Early risk factors for AD may alter brain anatomy, causing vulnerability to AD-related dementia later in life. In the perinatal period, both genes and learning disabilities have been associated with the development of distinct AD phenotypes. During early childhood, education and intellect, as well as body growth, may predispose to AD through alterations in cognitive and brain reserve, though the specific mediators of neural injury are disputed. Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) may predispose to AD by influencing adult SES and cognition. Association of these risk factors with underlying AD pathology (rather than just clinical diagnosis) has not been sufficiently examined. KEY MESSAGES: Factors that impede or alter brain growth during early life could render certain brain regions or networks selectively vulnerable to the onset, accumulation or spread of AD-related pathology during later life. Careful life-course epidemiology could provide clues as to why the brain systematically degenerates during AD.",2015,,Neuroepidemiology,45,4,237-54,,10.1159/000439568,26501691,#327,Seifan 2015

RESULTS: A total of 5522 cases and 4877 controls in 20 case-control studies were included. Obvious heterogeneity among studies was detected, and no significant association was observed between the NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism and AD risk. After exclusion of three studies, the heterogeneity disappeared and still no association was observed. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we did not find any significant association between this polymorphism and AD risk in both Asians and Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that the NOS3 Glu298Asp gene polymorphism is not a strong risk factor for AD. To further evaluate gene-to-gene and gene-to-environmental interactions between polymorphisms of NOS3 gene and AD risk, more studies with large groups of patients are required.",2014,Apr,Int J Neurosci,124,4,243-51,,10.3109/00207454.2013.834336,23952620,#326,Hua 2014
Pubmed,Relationship of Antiphospholipid Antibodies to Risk of Dementia: A Systematic Review.,Bucci T; Menichelli D; Pignatelli P; Triggiani M; Violi F; Pastori D,"Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are well-known risk factors for venous and arterial thrombosis, but their association with cognitive dysfunction has not been widely investigated in the general population and in patients with primary and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We performed a systematic review searching MEDLINE via PubMed and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases for observational studies reporting on the association between aPL and dementia in the general population, in subjects carrying aPL, in patients with cognitive disorder/dementia, and in primary and secondary APS. Prevalence of anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG ranged from 5.9% to 31.1% in the general population, with aCL titers being more elevated in subjects with functional decline of cognitive functions or with neurological alterations as detected by imaging. The prevalence of aPL ranged from 6.0 to 56.6% in patients with vascular dementia. Regarding patients with primary and secondary APS, a severe cognitive deficit has been described in up to 60% of patients, 33.3% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-APS and 22.2% of SLE patients without aPL. Five studies included patients with primary APS with divergent results, while 18 studies investigated the association between aPL and cognitive impairment in patients with SLE. Of these, 14 reported a positive association between aPL, mostly aCL and LAC, and cognitive impairment while little evidence on anti Î_2-Glycoprotein I exists. Mechanisms leading to cognitive dysfunction are not well characterized and may include vascular aPL-induced micro and macro-thrombosis and immune-mediated neuronal toxicity pathways in the cerebral district.",2019,,J Alzheimers Dis,69,2,561-576,,10.3233/JAD-181294,31104025,#324,Bucci 2019
Pubmed,Linking Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes: Novel shared susceptibility genes detected by cFDR approach.,Wang XF; Lin X; Li DY; Zhou R; Greenbaum J; Chen YC; Zeng CP; Peng LP; Wu KH; Ao ZX; Lu JM; Guo YF; Shen J; Deng HW,"BACKGROUND: Both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) occur commonly in the aging populations and T2D has been considered as an important risk factor for AD. The heritability of both diseases is estimated to be over 50%. However, common pleiotropic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/loci have not been well-defined. The aim of this study is to analyze two large public accessible GWAS datasets to identify novel common genetic loci for T2D and/or AD. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The recently developed novel conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach was used to analyze the summary GWAS datasets from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and Diabetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) to identify novel susceptibility genes for AD and T2D. RESULTS: We identified 78 SNPs (including 58 novel SNPs) that were associated with AD in Europeans conditional on T2D (cFDR<0.05). 66 T2D SNPs (including 40 novel SNPs) were identified by conditioning on SNPs association with AD (cFDR<0.05). A conjunction-cFDR (ccFDR) analysis detected 8 pleiotropic SNPs with a significance threshold of ccFDR<0.05 for both AD and T2D, of which 5 SNPs (rs6982393, rs4734295, rs7812465, rs10510109, rs2421016) were novel findings. Furthermore, among the 8 SNPs annotated at 6 different genes, 3 corresponding genes TP53INP1, TOMM40 and C8orf38 were related to mitochondrial dysfunction, critically involved in oxidative stress, which potentially contribute to the etiology of both AD and T2D. CONCLUSION: Our study provided evidence for shared genetic loci between T2D and AD in European subjects by using cFDR and ccFDR analyses. These results may provide novel insight into the etiology and potential therapeutic targets of T2D and/or AD.",2017,Sep,J Neurol Sci,380,,262-272,,10.1016/j.jns.2017.07.044,28870582,#322,Wang 2017
Pubmed,Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease in Chinese population: a meta-analysis.,Liu M; Bian C; Zhang J; Wen F,"The relationship between Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is relatively well established in Caucasians, but less established in other ethnicities. To examine the association between ApoE polymorphism and the onset of AD in Chinese population, we searched the commonly used electronic databases between January 2000 and November 2013 for relevant studies. Total 20 studies, including 1576 cases and 1741 controls, were retrieved. The results showed statistically significant positive association between risk factor Îµ4 allele carriers and AD in Chinese population (OR = 3.93, 95% CI = 3.37-4.58, P < 0.00001). Genotype ApoE Îµ4/Îµ4 and Îµ4/Îµ3 have statistically significant association with AD as well (Îµ4/Îµ4: OR = 11.76, 95% CI = 6.38-21.47, P < 0.00001; Îµ4/Îµ3: OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 2.57-3.69, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, the frequency of the ApoE Îµ3 is lower in AD than that in the health controls, and the difference of Îµ3 allele is also statistically significant (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.37-0.47, P < 0.00001). No significant heterogeneity was observed among all studies. This meta-analysis suggests that the subject with at least one ApoE Îµ4 allele has higher risk suffering from AD than controls in Chinese population. The results also provide a support for the protection effect of ApoE Îµ3 allele in developing AD.",2014,Mar,Sci Rep,4,,4383,,10.1038/srep04383,24632849,#319,Liu 2014
Pubmed,Cognitive leisure activities and future risk of cognitive impairment and dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis.,Yates LA; Ziser S; Spector A; Orrell M,"BACKGROUND: As life expectancies continue to rise, modifiable lifestyle factors that may prevent cognitive decline and dementia in later life become increasingly important in order to maintain quality of life in old age. METHODS: Five meta-analyses were conducted on data from papers identified in a systematic review. Studies were grouped according to outcomes (dementia, cognitive impairment including amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitive decline) and output (risk (RR), odds (OR), or hazard ratios (HR)). RESULTS: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria and quality assessments. Four of five meta-analyses showed significant associations between participation in cognitive leisure activities and reduced risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.85) and dementia (HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.46-0.74; RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42-0.90; OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.90). However, one pooled analysis of cognitive impairment studies did not reach significance (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.71-1.02). Mentally stimulating leisure activities were significantly associated with later life cognition (Î_ = 0.11, p = 0.05), better memory (Î_ = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.11-0.29), speed of processing (Î_ = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.29-0.45), and executive functioning (Î_ = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.15-0.29), and less decline in overall cognition (Î_ = -0.23, p < 0.01), language (Î_ = -0.11, p < 0.05), and executive functioning (Î_ = -0.13, p < 0.05). Activities were also shown to reduce rate of cognitive decline (estimate = 0.03, SE = 0.01, p = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: There is increasing evidence that participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities may contribute to a reduction of risk of dementia and cognitive impairment in later life. Promoting involvement in such activities across lifespan could be an important focus for primary prevention strategies for governments and health services.",2016,Nov,Int Psychogeriatr,28,11,1791-1806,,10.1017/S1041610216001137,27502691,#318,Yates 2016
Pubmed,Clinical Significance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Markers of Vascular Brain Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Debette S; Schilling S; Duperron MG; Larsson SC; Markus HS,"IMPORTANCE: Covert vascular brain injury (VBI) is highly prevalent in community-dwelling older persons, but its clinical and therapeutic implications are debated. OBJECTIVE: To better understand the clinical significance of VBI to optimize prevention strategies for the most common age-related neurological diseases, stroke and dementia. DATA SOURCE: We searched for articles in PubMed between 1966 and December 22, 2017, studying the association of 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of covert VBI (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] of presumed vascular origin, MRI-defined covert brain infarcts [BIs], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], and perivascular spaces [PVSs]) with incident stroke, dementia, or death. STUDY SELECTION: Data were taken from prospective, longitudinal cohort studies including 50 or more adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We performed inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses with random effects and z score-based meta-analyses for WMH burden. The significance threshold was Pâ€‰<â€‰.003 (17 independent tests). We complied with the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), dementia (all and Alzheimer disease), and death. RESULTS: Of 2846 articles identified, 94 studies were eligible, with up to 14 529 participants for WMH, 16 012 participants for BI, 15 693 participants for CMB, and 4587 participants for PVS. Extensive WMH burden was associated with higher risk of incident stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.93-3.12; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.65-3.47; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.54-6.52; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002), dementia (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.40-2.43; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), Alzheimer disease (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.22-1.84; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), and death (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.69-2.36; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Presence of MRI-defined BIs was associated with higher risk of incident stroke (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.87-3.04; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.67-2.85; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.75-8.27; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), and death (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.40-1.91; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Presence of CMBs was associated with increased risk of stroke (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.55-2.53; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.40-2.63; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.15-6.80; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), and death (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.31-1.80; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Data on PVS were limited and insufficient to conduct meta-analyses but suggested an association of high PVS burden with increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death; this requires confirmation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We report evidence that MRI markers of VBI have major clinical significance.

Pubmed,Interleukin-6 -174G/C polymorphism and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Caucasians: a meta-analysis.,Han XM; Wang CH; Sima X; Liu SY,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), identified as a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine, plays important roles in the acute inflammatory response and in the modulation of the neuroimmune response. To date, large amounts of epidemiological studies have been performed to investigate the association between the IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Inconclusive results, however, have been reported. We aimed to assess the effect of the IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism on AD susceptibility with the use of a meta-analysis. 14 studies involving 3769 cases of AD and 9431 control subjects were identified by a search of Pubmed, Embase and ISI Web of Science databases. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism and AD risk were computed using fixed- or random-effects model when appropriate. Obvious heterogeneity among studies was detected, and a borderline statistically significant association was observed between the IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism and AD risk in Caucasians (GG vs. CC: OR=1.35, 95%CI, 1.06-1.72; GG/GC vs. CC: OR=1.27, 95%CI, 1.05-1.53, respectively). After exclusion of one study, the heterogeneity disappeared and no significant association was observed between the polymorphism and AD risk. These findings indicate that the IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism may not be an independent risk factor for the development of AD.",2011,Oct,Neurosci Lett,504,1,8-Apr,,10.1016/j.neulet.2011.06.055,21767605,#310,Han 2011
Pubmed,Statins and vascular dementia: a review.,Giannopoulos S; Katsanos AH; Kosmidou M; Tsivgoulis G,"The impact of statin therapy on dementia has been a hot topic of debate over the last decade and still remains highly controversial. Among all causes of dementia, vascular dementia (VaD) is the one type that is more likely to benefit from statins. To date no randomized clinical trials have been published and no systematic review has investigated a possible preventive effect of statins on the VaD subtype. In the present literature review, we tried to identify all available data on the effect of statins specifically in patients with VaD, and to further discuss this possible association. Our literature search highlighted two cross-sectional studies, two prospective cohort studies, and one retrospective cohort study. Two of the studies found a significant positive effect of statin treatment on VaD, depicted by the lower incidence of VaD in statin users, while the others reported non-significant associations. The relatively small numbers of VaD patients and statin users, as well as the presence of confounders and biases, make the interpretation of results extremely difficult. Statins may exert a benefit in the prevention of all-type dementia and VaD, through several mechanisms except for hyperlipidemia reduction. A well-designed randomized clinical trial is the ideal study design to address the effect of statin therapy in VaD and to draw final conclusions.",2014,,J Alzheimers Dis,42 Suppl 3,,S315-20,,10.3233/JAD-132366,24662103,#308,Giannopoulos 2014
Pubmed,Incidence of Skin Tears and Risk Factors: A Systematic Literature Review.,Strazzieri-Pulido KC; Peres GR; Campanili TC; de Gouveia Santos VL,"Skin tears are traumatic wounds resulting from friction and shearing forces. Clinical practice strongly indicates that skin tears are a prevalent problem but their incidence is not well established in the literature. This systematic literature review identified and evaluated the available literature on the incidence and risk factors for skin tears in adults and the elderly. Inclusion criteria were epidemiological studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese languages from January 1990 through June 2014 and available in full text. Study quality was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Guidelines for Critically Appraising Studies of Prevalence or Incidence of a Health Problem. Five studies reporting incidence of skin tears met the selection criteria. Reported incidence rates of skin tears ranged from 2.23% to 92% in long-term care facilities and varied from 2.1% among men to 4.6% among women living in the community. The most prevalent risk factor for skin tears was old age, followed by impaired mobility, falls and accidental injuries, previous skin tears, cognitive deficit/dementia, dependence in transfers, and upper limbs. Further epidemiological studies on skin tears are necessary to elucidate the cause of these injuries and identify the profile of people at risk for skin tears, contributing to the development and implementation of appropriate preventive interventions.",2017,Jan/Feb,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,44,1,29-33,,10.1097/WON.0000000000000288,28060001,#306,Strazzieri-Pulido 2017
Pubmed,Beta-Blockers for the Secondary Prevention of Myocardial Infarction in People with Dementia: A Systematic Review.,Lanham D; Ali S; Davis D; Rawle MJ,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in industrialized countries. The use of beta-blockers is well established as a secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. However, little is known about the benefits of beta-blockers for people living with dementia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of beta-blockers in people with dementia who have had a myocardial infarction, in order to identify associations between medication use, mortality, re-infarction and functional decline. METHODS: We searched for all studies (randomized trials, observational cohorts) reporting beta-blocker use in populations with both dementia and previous myocardial infarction. Relevant keywords were used in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science up to October 2018. Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers. Quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. PRISMA recommendations were followed throughout. RESULTS: Two observational studies were included, representing 10,992 individuals in a community setting and 129,092 individuals from a hospital record-linkage study. One showed use of beta-blockers reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.64- 0.86) alongside evidence for an increased rate of functional decline in individuals agedâ‰¥65 with moderate to severe cognitive impairment (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.11- 1.61)). The second study did not find an association between beta-blocker use and mortality in the population living with dementia. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to support use of beta-blockers to persons living with dementia. A single study provides limited evidence that beta-blockers improve survival rates but with associated detrimental effects on functional status in nursing home residents with cognitive impairment. Decisions to continue beta-blockers in persons living with dementia should be made on an individual basis.",2019,,J Alzheimers Dis,71,4,1105-1114,,10.3233/JAD-190503,31476156,#304,Lanham 2019
Pubmed,Estrogen receptor Î± gene polymorphisms and risk of Alzheimer's disease: evidence from a meta-analysis.,Cheng D; Liang B; Hao Y; Zhou W,"OBJECTIVE: Human estrogen receptor Î± (ESR1), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, is one of the key mediators of hormonal response in estrogen-sensitive tissues. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that two of the most widely studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ESR1 - PvuII (T/C, rs223493) and Xbal (A/G, rs9340799) - are possibly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, individual study results are still controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Science Direct, SpringerLink, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for eligible studies assessing the association of ESR1 polymorphisms and AD risk (last search performed in November 2013). Thereafter, a meta-analysis of 13,192 subjects from 18 individual studies was conducted to evaluate the association between ESR1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to AD. RESULTS: The results indicated that a significant association was found between the ESR1 PvuII polymorphism and AD risk in Caucasian populations (CC + CT versus TT, odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.28, P=0.03; CT versus TT, OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.31, P=0.02), whereas no evidence of association was found in Asian populations. Nevertheless, we did not find any significant association between the ESR1 XbaI polymorphism and AD risk for any model in Caucasian and Asian populations (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on this meta-analysis, we conclude that the ESR1 PvuII polymorphism might be a risk factor in AD development in Caucasian populations, not in Asian populations. Further confirmation is needed from better-designed and larger studies.",2014,,Clin Interv Aging,9,,1031-8,,10.2147/CIA.S65921,25061285,#301,Cheng 2014

A previous meta-analysis about the association between AD susceptibility and CYP46A1 intron-2T/C (rs754203) has led to inconsistent conclusions. To assess the relationship between the CYP46A1 rs754203 polymorphism and AD risk more exactly, relevant literature was recruited by searching the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM), CNKI, Wan fang, and reference lists of articles. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed and random effects models, publication bias was tested by funnel plot and Egger's test, heterogeneity was assessed with I(2) statistics. Sixteen case-control studies were included with a total of 7788 individuals, involving 3960 AD patients and 3828 controls. The combined results showed no significant differences in allele comparison C vs. T (OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.86-1.26), recessive model CC vs. TC+TT (OR=1.24, 95% CI=0.90-1.69) and dominant model CC+TC vs. TT (OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.84-1.27). When stratifying for ethnicity, no significant associations were detected in Caucasians or in Asians. Our results suggested that CYP46A1 rs754203 is a minor risk factor for AD.

Nutrition is emerging as a key element of healthy life since both obesity and malnutrition are established risk factors for morbidity and disability. The aim of this umbrella review (UR) is to summarize the findings of all current systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyzes (MAs) on the effectiveness of nutritional intervention designed to promote healthy aging in older individuals. METHODS: Eligible articles published in English or Italian between January 2000 and May 2016 were identified in six databases. Only studies that analyzed nutritional interventions in the population of 65 years and over, or papers specifically targeting older adults were deemed eligible. RESULTS: Twenty-eight papers, out of which twenty-five SRs and three MAs, met the inclusion criteria and were included in this umbrella SR. Supplementation with vitamin D and other kind of products was highly effective in preventing falls and fractures. Furthermore, several interventions, ranging from the prescription of supplements to environmental and organizational programs, resulted in an improvement in energy and protein intake, as well as positive weight outcomes. Positive findings were also found for the elderly at risk of malnutrition and for older patients with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this UR indicate that the use of a wide range of supplements and environmental and organizational intervention improve a number of anthropometric, nutritional and functional indices in the elderly.",2018,Apr,Eur J Public Health,28,2,275-283,,10.1093/eurpub/ckx199,29228152,#39,Poscia 2018

Carotid atherosclerosis (CA) may be causative in the development of WMH, SBI and eventually brain atrophy. Aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the existing evidence linking CA to WMH, SBI and brain atrophy. METHODS: The relation between CA and WMH, SBI and brain atrophy was investigated through the systematic search of online databases up to September 2015 and manual searching of references and related citations. Pooled estimates were calculated by random-effects model, using restricted maximum likelihood method with inverse variance weighting method. RESULTS: Of the 3536 records identified, fifteen were included in the systematic review and 9 were found to be eligible for the meta-analysis. CA was significantly associated with the presence of WMH (Odds Ratio, OR 1.42, confidence interval, CI 1.22-1.66, p<0.0001) and of SBI (OR 1.89, CI 1.46-2.45, p<0.0001). No meta-analysis could be performed for the relation between CA and brain atrophy due to the lack of suitable studies. CONCLUSIONS: CA was found to be associated to WMH and SBI.

Pubmed,Efficacy of antiresorptive agents for preventing fractures in Japanese patients with an increased fracture risk: review of the literature.,Iwamoto J; Sato Y; Takeda T; Matsumoto H,"The aim of the present review was to clarify the efficacy of currently available potent antiresorptive agents for preventing fractures in Japanese patients with an increased fracture risk. PubMed was used to search the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with the following search terms: fracture, etidronate, alendronate, risedronate, minodronate, raloxifene, bazedoxifene and Japan. The inclusion criteria were papers written in English, â‰¥50 subjects per group and a study period of â‰¥1 year. Fourteen RCTs met these criteria. The efficacy of antiresorptive agents for preventing vertebral, nonvertebral and hip fractures was investigated. There was evidence that raloxifene reduced the incidence of clinical vertebral fractures, while etidronate, alendronate and minodronate (but not bazedoxifene) reduced the incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in patients with postmenopausal or involutional osteoporosis. Head-to-head trials showed that alendronate and raloxifene had similar efficacy for preventing vertebral fractures in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, while risedronate was not inferior to etidronate for reducing the incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in patients with involutional osteoporosis. Alendronate reduced the incidence of hip fractures in patients with Parkinson's disease, and risedronate reduced the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease or stroke. In conclusion, the present review confirmed the efficacy of etidronate, minodronate and raloxifene for the prevention of vertebral fractures, the efficacy of alendronate for vertebral and hip fractures, and the efficacy of risedronate for vertebral, nonvertebral and hip fractures in Japanese patients with an increased fracture risk.",2012,Mar,Drugs Aging,29,3,191-203,,10.2165/11597480-000000000-00000,22372723,#33,Iwamoto 2012

The objective of this study is to evaluate the presence of spatial and nonspatial cognitive deficits in patients with bilateral vestibulopathy. As different causes of bilateral vestibulopathy are associated with hearing loss, the objective is to evaluate if these cognitive deficits are due to the vestibular loss of the patients with bilateral vestibulopathy, or to their hearing loss, or both. DESIGN: We performed a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. (1) Data sources: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. (2) Study selection: Cross-sectional studies investigating cognitive performances in human patients with bilateral vestibulopathy confirmed by quantitative vestibular testing. (3) Data extraction: Independent extraction of articles by three authors using predefined data fields, including patient- and control characteristics and cognitive outcomes. RESULTS: Ten studies reporting on 126 patients with bilateral vestibulopathy matched the inclusion criteria. Cognitive domains evaluated in patients with bilateral vestibulopathy included visuospatial abilities, memory, language, attention, and executive function. In only three studies, hearing performance of the included patients was briefly described. Nearly all studies demonstrated a significant impairment of spatial cognition in patients with bilateral vestibulopathy. In the few papers investigating nonspatial cognition, worse outcome was demonstrated in patients with bilateral vestibular loss performing cognitive tasks assessing attentional performance, memory, and executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence exists that patients with bilateral vestibulopathy suffer from impaired spatial cognition. Recent studies even suggest impairment in other cognitive domains than spatial cognition. However, in all previous studies, conclusions on the link between cognitive performance and vestibular loss were drawn without taken hearing loss into consideration as a possible cause of the cognitive impairment.",2019,Jul/Aug,Ear Hear,40,4,757-765,,10.1097/AUD.0000000000000679,31242136,#30,Dobbels 2019
Pubmed,Atrial Fibrillation Is Associated With Syncope and Falls in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Malik V; Gallagher C; Linz D; Elliott AD; Emami M; Kadhim K; Mishima R; Hendriks JML; Mahajan R; Arnolda L; Sanders P; Lau DH,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential association of atrial fibrillation (AF) to syncope and falls, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis given the increasing prevalence of AF in older adults as well as emerging data that it is a risk factor for dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CENTRAL, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to January 31, 2019, to retrieve relevant studies. Search terms consisted of MeSH, tree headings, and keywords relating patients with ""AF,"" ""falls,"" ""syncope,"" and ""postural hypotension."" When possible; results were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included, with 7 studies (36,444 patients; mean Â± SD age, 72Â±10 years) reporting an association between AF and falls and 3 studies (6769 patients; mean Â± SD age, 65Â±3 years) reporting an association between AF and syncope. Pooled analyses demonstrate that AF is independently associated with falls (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.33; P=.001) and syncope (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.20-2.94; P=.006). There was overall moderate bias and low-moderate heterogeneity (I(2)=37%; P=.11) for falls and moderate bias with low statistical heterogeneity (I(2)=0%; P=.44) for syncope. Persistent AF, but not paroxysmal AF, was associated with orthostatic intolerance in 1 study (4408 patients; mean Â± SD age, 66Â±6 years). CONCLUSION: AF is independently associated with syncope and falls in older adults. Further studies are needed to delineate mechanistic links and to guide management to improve outcomes in these patients.

Pubmed,What is the evidence to guide best practice for the management of older people with cognitive impairment presenting to emergency departments? A systematic review.,Schnitker L; Martin-Khan M; Beattie E; Gray L,"The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of research-based studies to identify practices designed to meet the specific care needs of older cognitively impaired patients in emergency departments (ED). A systematic literature review of studies was completed using PRIMSA methodology. The search criteria included articles from both emergency and acute care settings. A total of 944 articles were screened, and a total of 43 articles were identified as eligible. The review found a number of intervention studies to improve quality of care for older persons with cognitive impairment carried out or commenced in emergency settings, including interventions to improve cognitive impairment recognition (n = 9) and clinical approaches to reduce falls (n = 1) and both delirium incidence and prevalence (n = 2). Relevant studies carried out in acute care settings regarding cognitive impairment recognition (n = 4) and primary and secondary prevention of delirium (n = 18) and intervention studies that reduced the prescription of deliriogenic drugs (n = 1), reduced behavioral symptoms and discomfort (n = 7), and improved nutritional intake (n = 1) in hospitalized older persons with dementia were also identified. There is limited research available that reports interventions that improve the quality of care of older ED patients with cognitive impairment.

Previously, hormone therapy was used for the primary prevention of these chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: To update evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force on the benefits and harms of hormone therapy in reducing risks for chronic conditions. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries from June 1, 2011, through August 1, 2016. Surveillance for new evidence in targeted publications was conducted through July 1, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized clinical trials reporting health outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; meta-analyses when at least 3 similar studies were available. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Beneficial or harmful changes in risks for various chronic conditions. RESULTS: Eighteen trials (nâ€‰=â€‰40â€¯058; range, 142-16â€¯608; mean age, 53-79 years) were included. Women using estrogen-only therapy compared with placebo had significantly lower risks, per 10â€¯000 person-years, for diabetes (-19 cases [95% CI, -34 to -3]) and fractures (-53 cases [95% CI, -69 to -39]). Risks were statistically significantly increased, per 10â€¯000 person-years, for gallbladder disease (30 more cases [95% CI, 16 to 48]), stroke (11 more cases [95% CI, 2 to 23]), venous thromboembolism (11 more cases [95% CI, 3 to 22]), and urinary incontinence (1261 more cases [95% CI, 880 to 1689]). Women using estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo experienced significantly lower risks, per 10â€¯000 person-years, for colorectal cancer (-6 cases [95% CI, -9 to -1]), diabetes (-14 cases [95% CI, -24 to -3), and fractures (-44 cases [95% CI, -71 to -13). Risks, per 10â€¯000 person-years, were significantly increased for invasive breast cancer (9 more cases [95% CI, 1 to 19]), probable dementia (22 more cases [95% CI, 4 to 53]), gallbladder disease (21 more cases [95% CI, 10 to 34]), stroke (9 more cases [95% CI, 2 to 19]), urinary incontinence (876 more cases [95% CI, 606 to 1168]), and venous thromboembolism (21 more cases [95% CI, 12 to 33]).

Pubmed,Assessing for unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of physical activity subtypes: a focus on psychiatric disorders.,Eyre HA; Baune BT,"Physical activity (PA) is emerging as a safe and effective tool in the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders. PA subtypes include aerobic, resistance, flexibility, neuromotor (involving balance, agility and co-ordination), mind-body (e.g. tai chi, qi gong and yoga) and mixed type trainings. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that PA subtypes can have positive clinical effects, however the effects on the symptomatology may vary according to the PA subtype. It therefore stands to reason that various PA subtypes may modulate the immune system and neuroplastic processes differently. This systematic review aims to assess the immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of various PA subtypes, particularly in unipolar depression and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). The literature suggests several unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles for PA subtypes (i.e. resistance, aerobic and mind-body) in depression and ARCD. In depression, levels of various cytokines at baseline may predict treatment response to subtypes of PA and pharmacological agents. The pro-neuroplastic effects of resistance and aerobic PA in ARCD may differ due to variances in neurotrophin profiles. At this stage of literature in the field, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the specific immunomodulatory and neuroplastic pathways involved in these PA subtypes given of the small number of comparative studies and methodological heterogeneity between studies (e.g. study population age and illness severity, as well as duration and intensity of PA intervention). This important field requires well-designed, high-quality comparative studies to better describe unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles.",2014,Jul,Brain Behav Immun,39,,42-55,,10.1016/j.bbi.2013.10.026,24269526,#24,Eyre 2014

METHODS: The guideline panel systematically reviewed MCI prevalence, prognosis, and treatment articles according to AAN evidence classification criteria, and based recommendations on evidence and modified Delphi consensus. RESULTS: MCI prevalence was 6.7% for ages 60-64, 8.4% for 65-69, 10.1% for 70-74, 14.8% for 75-79, and 25.2% for 80-84. Cumulative dementia incidence was 14.9% in individuals with MCI older than age 65 years followed for 2 years. No high-quality evidence exists to support pharmacologic treatments for MCI. In patients with MCI, exercise training (6 months) is likely to improve cognitive measures and cognitive training may improve cognitive measures. MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS: Clinicians should assess for MCI with validated tools in appropriate scenarios (Level B). Clinicians should evaluate patients with MCI for modifiable risk factors, assess for functional impairment, and assess for and treat behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms (Level B). Clinicians should monitor cognitive status of patients with MCI over time (Level B). Cognitively impairing medications should be discontinued where possible and behavioral symptoms treated (Level B). Clinicians may choose not to offer cholinesterase inhibitors (Level B); if offering, they must first discuss lack of evidence (Level A). Clinicians should recommend regular exercise (Level B). Clinicians may recommend cognitive training (Level C). Clinicians should discuss diagnosis, prognosis, long-term planning, and the lack of effective medicine options (Level B), and may discuss biomarker research with patients with MCI and families (Level C).",2018,Jan,Neurology,90,3,126-135,,10.1212/WNL.0000000000004826,29282327,#23,Petersen 2018
Pubmed,Characteristics of nursing home residents and physical restraint: a systematic literature review.,Hofmann H; Hahn S,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To analyse and to summarise factors associated with nursing home residents' characteristics which could lead to physical restraint, and to investigate the consequences of physical restraint use for this population. BACKGROUND: Even though the application of physical restraint is highly controversial, prevalence rates show that it is a common intervention in nursing homes. Residents' characteristics seem to be important to predict the use of physical restraint. Evidence suggests that restrained nursing home residents may have physical and psychological disadvantages as a consequence of being restrained. METHODS: A systematic literature research involving the databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane Library was carried out for articles published from January 2005-November 2011. Nine Studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and the quality assessment. RESULTS: Restrained residents had low activities of daily living (ADL) scores and severe cognitive impairment. Residents with low cognitive status and serious mobility impairments were at high risk to be restrained, as well as residents with previous fall and/or fracture. Repeated verbal and physical agitation was found to be positively associated with restraint use. Possible consequences of physical restraint were as follows: lower cognitive and ADL performance, higher walking dependence, furthermore falls, pressure ulcers, urinary and faecal incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review reveals notable resident-related factors for physical restraint use. The consequences of restraint seem to negatively influence residents' physical and psychological well-being. Physical restraint seems to be an important risk factor for residents' further health problems. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Resident's characteristics appear to be decisive factors for the use of physical restraint. Nurses need a high level of expertise and competence in evaluating the individual residents' situation and deciding further steps, with respect for the autonomy and dignity of the person.",2014,Nov,J Clin Nurs,23,21-22,3012-24,,10.1111/jocn.12384,24125061,#21,Hofmann 2014

Studies estimating the cost-effectiveness as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost per quality-adjusted life year, cost per disability-adjusted life year and cost per other measurable results were included. Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale, and Consensus on Health Economic Criteria list were used for rating the quality of the evidence.Results: Ten studies involving 1462 participants were included. Aerobic training, progressive strength training, and a pragmatic physiotherapy program (combination of stretching, strength, and balance training) were reported as potentially cost-effective for older adults with vascular cognitive impairment, falls prevention in Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis respectively. Physiotherapy as an adjuvant for pain control was also reported as cost-effective for reflex sympathetic dystrophy. One study testing extra physiotherapy-by-physiotherapy assistant in cerebral palsy and two studies testing extra therapy using a robotic arm and Wii therapy for hand rehabilitation in stroke were reported as not cost-effective.Conclusions: There are limited studies that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy treatments in neurological disorders.

Pubmed,Cognitive impairment and 30-day rehospitalization rate in patients with acute heart failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Kewcharoen J; Trongtorsak A; Kanitsoraphan C; Prasitlumkum N; Mekritthikrai R; Techorueangwiwat C; Limpruttidham N; Rattanawong P,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is one of the world leading causes of hospitalization and rehospitalization. Cognitive impairment has been identified as a risk factor for rehospitalization in patients with heart failure. However, previous studies reported mixed results. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between cognitive impairment and 30-day rehospitalization in patients with HF. METHOD: We performed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018 in the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Included studies were cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies or randomized controlled trials that compared the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in HF patients with cognitive impairment and those without. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I(2) statistic using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Five studies with a total of 2,342 participants (1,004 participants had cognitive impairment) were included for meta-analysis. In random-effect model, cognitive impairment significantly increased the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in HF participants (pooled RR=1.63, 95%CI: 1.19-2.24], I(2)=64.2%, p=0.002). Subgroup analysis was performed on the studies that excluded patients with dementia. The results also showed that cognitive impairment significantly increased the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in participants with HF (pooled RR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.05-1.59, I(2)=0.0%, p=0.016), which was consistent with our overall analysis.

Pubmed,Predicting outcome in older hospital patients with delirium: a systematic literature review.,Jackson TA; Wilson D; Richardson S; Lord JM,"OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a serious neuropsychiatric syndrome common in older hospitalised adults. It is associated with poor outcomes, however not all people with delirium have poor outcomes and the risk factors for adverse outcomes within this group are not well described. The objective was to report which predictors of outcome had been reported in the literature. METHODS: We performed a systematic review by an initial electronic database search of MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO using four key search criteria. These were: (1) participants with a diagnosis of delirium, (2) clearly defined outcome measures, (3) a clearly defined variable as predictor of outcomes and (4) participants in the general hospital, rehabilitation and care home settings, excluding intensive care. Studies were then selected in a systematic fashion using specific predetermined criteria by three reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 559 articles were screened, and 57 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Twenty seven studies describing 18 different predictors of poor outcome were reported. The studies were rated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Score and were generally at low risk of bias. Four broad themes of predictor were identified; five delirium related predictors, two co-morbid psychiatric illness related predictors, eight patient related predictors and three biomarker related predictors. The most numerously described and clinically important appear to be the duration of the delirium episode, a hypoactive motor subtype, delirium severity and pre-existing psychiatric morbidity with dementia or depression. These are all associated with poorer delirium outcomes. CONCLUSION: Important predictors of poor outcomes in patients with delirium have been demonstrated. These could be used in clinical practice to focus direct management and guide discussions regarding prognosis. These results also demonstrate a number of key unknowns, where further research to explore delirium prognosis is recommended and is vital to improve understanding and management of this condition.",2016,Apr,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,31,4,392-9,,10.1002/gps.4344,26302258,#18,Jackson 2016
Pubmed,"A systematic review of factors influencing NHS health check uptake: invitation methods, patient characteristics, and the impact of interventions.",Bunten A; Porter L; Gold N; Bogle V,"BACKGROUND: The NHS Health Check (NHSHC) is a risk assessment for those aged 40-74 without a pre-existing condition in England, with the aim of preventing stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia. Uptake has been lower than anticipated. Ensuring that a high percentage of eligible patients receive a NHSHC is key to optimising the clinical and cost effectiveness of the programme. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight interventions and invitation methods that increase the uptake of NHSHCs, and to identify whether the effectiveness of these interact with broader patient and contextual factors. METHOD: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA checklist. Papers were eligible if they explored the impact of at least one of (i) interventions, (ii) invitation methods or (iii) broader factors on NHSHC uptake. Ten databases were searched in January 2016 and seven were searched in March 2018. Nine-hundred-and-forty-five papers were identified, 238 were screened and 64 full texts were assessed for eligibility. Nine studies were included in the review. RESULTS: The nine studies were all from peer reviewed journals. They included two randomised controlled trials, one observational cohort and six cross-sectional studies. Different invitation methods may be more effective for different groups of patients based on their ethnicity and gender. One intervention to enhance invitation letters effectively increased uptake but another did not. In addition, individual patient characteristics (such as age, gender, ethnicity and risk level) were found to influence uptake. This review also finds that uptake varies significantly by GP practice, which could be due either to unidentified practice-level factors or deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of different invitation methods for different population groups. Research should examine how existing invitation methods can be enhanced to drive uptake whilst reducing health inequalities.

Milk and other dairy products may contribute to the prevention of physical and cognitive impairment. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of dairy product intake for preventing cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and frailty in the elderly population. A systematic search for publications in electronic databases [MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews] from 2009 to 2018 identified observational and interventional studies in English and Spanish that tested the relation between dairy product consumption and cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and frailty in community-dwelling older people. We assessed the participants, the type of exposure or intervention, the outcomes, and the quality of evidence. We screened a total of 661 records and included 6 studies (5 observational prospective cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial). Regarding cognitive impairment, the relation cannot be firmly established. Consumption of milk at midlife may be negatively associated with verbal memory performance. In older women, high intakes of dairy desserts and ice cream were associated with cognitive decline. On the other hand, 1 study demonstrated a significant inverse relation between dairy intake and development of Alzheimer disease among older Japanese subjects. The consumption of dairy products by older people may reduce the risk of frailty, especially with high consumption of low-fat milk and yogurt, and may also reduce the risk of sarcopenia by improving skeletal muscle mass through the addition of nutrient-rich dairy proteins (ricotta cheese) to the habitual diet. Despite the scarcity of evidence on the topic, our systematic review shows that there are some positive effects of dairy products on frailty and sarcopenia, whereas studies concerning cognitive decline have contradictory findings.",2019,May,Adv Nutr,10,suppl_2,S105-S119,,10.1093/advances/nmy105,31089731,#15,Cuesta-Triana 2019
Pubmed,Genome-wide meta-analysis of homocysteine and methionine metabolism identifies five one carbon metabolism loci and a novel association of ALDH1L1 with ischemic stroke.,Williams SR; Yang Q; Chen F; Liu X; Keene KL; Jacques P; Chen WM; Weinstein G; Hsu FC; Beiser A; Wang L; Bookman E; Doheny KF; Wolf PA; Zilka M; Selhub J; Nelson S; Gogarten SM; Worrall BB; Seshadri S; Sale MM,"Circulating homocysteine levels (tHcy), a product of the folate one carbon metabolism pathway (FOCM) through the demethylation of methionine, are heritable and are associated with an increased risk of common diseases such as stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and dementia. The FOCM is the sole source of de novo methyl group synthesis, impacting many biological and epigenetic pathways. However, the genetic determinants of elevated tHcy (hyperhomocysteinemia), dysregulation of methionine metabolism and the underlying biological processes remain unclear. We conducted independent genome-wide association studies and a meta-analysis of methionine metabolism, characterized by post-methionine load test tHcy, in 2,710 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and 2,100 participants from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, and then examined the association of the identified loci with incident stroke in FHS. Five genes in the FOCM pathway (GNMT [p = 1.60 Ã— 10(-63)], CBS [p = 3.15 Ã— 10(-26)], CPS1 [p = 9.10 Ã— 10(-13)], ALDH1L1 [p = 7.3 Ã— 10(-13)] and PSPH [p = 1.17 Ã— 10(-16)]) were strongly associated with the difference between pre- and post-methionine load test tHcy levels (Î”POST). Of these, one variant in the ALDH1L1 locus, rs2364368, was associated with incident ischemic stroke. Promoter analyses reveal genetic and epigenetic differences that may explain a direct effect on GNMT transcription and a downstream affect on methionine metabolism. Additionally, a genetic-score consisting of the five significant loci explains 13% of the variance of Î”POST in FHS and 6% of the variance in VISP. Association between variants in FOCM genes with Î”POST suggest novel mechanisms that lead to differences in methionine metabolism, and possibly the epigenome, impacting disease risk. These data emphasize the importance of a concerted effort to understand regulators of one carbon metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.",2014,Mar,PLoS Genet,10,3,e1004214,,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004214,24651765,#14,Williams 2014
Pubmed,Putting research in place: an innovative approach to providing contextualized evidence synthesis for decision makers.,Bornstein S; Baker R; Navarro P; Mackey S; Speed D; Sullivan M,"BACKGROUND: The Contextualized Health Research Synthesis Program (CHRSP), developed in 2007 by the Newfoundland and Labrador Centre for Applied Health Research, produces contextualized knowledge syntheses for health-system decision makers. The program provides timely, relevant, and easy-to-understand scientific evidence; optimizes evidence uptake; and, most importantly, attunes research questions and evidence to the specific context in which knowledge users must apply the findings. METHODS: As an integrated knowledge translation (KT) method, CHRSP: Involves intensive partnerships with senior healthcare decision makers who propose priority research topics and participate on research teams; Considers local context both in framing the research question and in reporting the findings; Makes economical use of resources by utilizing a limited number of staff; Uses a combination of external and local experts; and Works quickly by synthesizing high-level systematic review evidence rather than primary studies. Although it was developed in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the CHRSP methodology is adaptable to a variety of settings with distinctive features, such as those in rural, remote, and small-town locations. RESULTS: CHRSP has published 25 syntheses on priority topics chosen by the provincial healthcare system, including: Clinical and cost-effectiveness: telehealth, rural renal dialysis, point-of-care testing; Community-based health services: helping seniors age in place, supporting seniors with dementia, residential treatment centers for at-risk youth; Healthcare organization/service delivery: reducing acute-care length of stay, promoting flu vaccination among health workers, safe patient handling, age-friendly acute care; and Health promotion: diabetes prevention, promoting healthy dietary habits. These studies have been used by decision makers to inform local policy and practice decisions. CONCLUSIONS: By asking the health system to identify its own priorities and to participate directly in the research process, CHRSP fully integrates KT among researchers and knowledge users in healthcare in Newfoundland and Labrador. This high level of decision-maker buy-in has resulted in a corresponding level of uptake. CHRSP studies have directly informed a number of policy and practice directions, including the design of youth residential treatment centers, a provincial policy on single-use medical devices, and most recently, the opening of the province's first Acute Care for the Elderly hospital unit.",2017,Nov,Syst Rev,6,1,218,,10.1186/s13643-017-0606-4,29096710,#13,Bornstein 2017
Pubmed,Use of warfarin in long-term care: a systematic review.,Neidecker M; Patel AA; Nelson WW; Reardon G,"BACKGROUND: The use of warfarin in older patients requires special consideration because of concerns with comorbidities, interacting medications, and the risk of bleeding. Several studies have suggested that warfarin may be underused or inconsistently prescribed in long-term care (LTC); no published systematic review has evaluated warfarin use for stroke prevention in this setting. This review was conducted to summarize the body of published original research regarding the use of warfarin in the LTC population. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library was conducted from January 1985 to August 2010 to identify studies that reported warfarin use in LTC. Studies were grouped by (1) rates of warfarin use and prescribing patterns, (2) association of resident and institutional characteristics with warfarin prescribing, (3) prescriber attitudes and concerns about warfarin use, (4) warfarin management and monitoring, and (5) warfarin-related adverse events. Summaries of study findings and quality assessments of each study were developed. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common indication for warfarin use in LTC and use of warfarin for stroke survivors was common. Rates of warfarin use in AF were low in 5 studies, ranging from 17% to 57%. These usage rates were low even among residents with high stroke risk and low bleeding risk. Scored bleeding risk had no apparent association with warfarin use in AF. In physician surveys, factors associated with not prescribing warfarin included risk of falls, dementia, short life expectancy, and history of bleeding. International normalized ratio was in the target range approximately half of the time. The combined overall rate of warfarin-related adverse events and potential events was 25.5 per 100 resident months on warfarin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Among residents with AF, use of warfarin and maintenance of INR levels to prevent stroke appear to be suboptimal. Among prescribers, perceived challenges associated with warfarin therapy often outweigh its benefits. Further research is needed to explicitly consider the appropriate balancing of risks and benefits in this frail patient population.",2012,Apr,BMC Geriatr,12,,14,,10.1186/1471-2318-12-14,22480376,#12,Neidecker 2012
Pubmed,A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Factors Associated With Nonadherence and Discontinuation of Statins Among People Aged â‰¥65 Years.,Ofori-Asenso R; Jakhu A; Curtis AJ; Zomer E; Gambhir M; Jaana Korhonen M; Nelson M; Tonkin A; Liew D; Zoungas S,"BACKGROUND: Older individuals (aged â‰¥65 years) are commonly prescribed statins but may experience a range of barriers in adhering to therapy. The factors associated with poor statin adherence and/or discontinuation among this population have not been comprehensively reviewed. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify English articles published through December 12, 2016 that reported factors associated with nonadherence and/or discontinuation of statins among older persons. Data were pooled via random-effects meta-analysis techniques. RESULTS: Forty-five articles reporting data from more than 1.8 million older statin users from 13 countries were included. The factors associated with increased statin nonadherence were black/non-white race (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-1.98), female gender (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13), current smoker (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21), higher copayments (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.25-1.52), new user (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07), lower number of concurrent cardiovascular medications (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.09), primary prevention (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.40-1.59), having respiratory disorders (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.23) or depression (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.16), and not having renal disease (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.14). The factors associated with increased statin discontinuation were lower income status (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36), current smoker (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06-1.23), higher copayment (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.53-1.70), higher number of medications (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06), presence of dementia (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36), cancer (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.33) or respiratory disorders (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.34), primary prevention (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.24-2.22), and not having hypertension (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.20) or diabetes (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15).

Pubmed,Oral Health and Its Associated Factors Among Older Institutionalized Residents-A Systematic Review.,Wong FMF; Ng YTY; Leung WK,"The oral health of an ageing population, especially that of the institutionalized elderly population, constitutes a significant concern because it is closely linked to general health and the quality of life. Shared common risk factors drive the development and worsening of poor oral health and non-communicable diseases, which eventually lead to self-care inability. Several studies have reported on the poor oral health of the institutionalized elderly population. However, few comprehensive reports exist regarding the relationship between poor oral health, the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and the associated factors in this specific population. Objective: The objective is to describe recently reported oral health levels, the OHRQoL and the associated factors among older institutional residents. Methods: Studies published between July 2009 and June 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched. The population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) strategy was used as a guide. The reported factors related to poor oral health were identified (i.e., age, gender, educational level, acquired systemic conditions or dementia/cognitive impairment). Results: Twenty-five surveys (or study series) from 19 countries were included. The level of evidence reported by these studies was generally moderate to strong. The reported oral cleanliness and health of the surveyed institutionalized elderly were poor (>50% of residents had calculus; denture hygiene index > 80%). Gum (approximately 30% of dentate residents had moderate to severe periodontitis), teeth (decayed, missing or filled teeth >20), mucosa (>10% had mucosal lesions) and denture problems (up to 40%) were prevalent and were associated with a poor OHRQoL, especially in females, socially deprived residents or those with mild or above cognitive impairment. Those with a poor OHRQoL might show signs of poor nutrition. Conclusions: This report reviewed evidence-based knowledge on oral health, the OHRQoL and the associated factors among elderly institutional residents. Further research is needed to confirm these observations. For improved oral health, a better OHRQoL and the general well-being of older residents, clinical trials are needed, targeting modifiable factors, such as social inequality, oral healthcare accessibility, and/or nursing home service quality. The relationship between oral health, the OHRQoL and nutrition in this at-risk population also warrants exploration.",2019,Oct,Int J Environ Res Public Health,16,21,,,10.3390/ijerph16214132,31717812,#9,WongFMF 2019
Pubmed,"Internet-Based Interventions for Carers of Individuals With Psychiatric Disorders, Neurological Disorders, or Brain Injuries: Systematic Review.",Spencer L; Potterton R; Allen K; Musiat P; Schmidt U,"BACKGROUND: Nonprofessional carers who provide support to an individual with a psychiatric or neurological disorder will often themselves experience symptoms of stress, anxiety, or low mood, and they perceive that they receive little support. Internet-based interventions have previously been found to be effective in the prevention and treatment of a range of mental health difficulties in carers. OBJECTIVE: This review seeks to establish the status of internet-based interventions for informal (nonprofessional) carers of people with psychiatric or neurological disorders by investigating (1) the number and quality of studies evaluating the efficacy or effectiveness of internet-based carer interventions and (2) the impact that such interventions have on carer mental health, as well as (3) how internet-based interventions compare with other intervention types (eg, face-to-face treatment). METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in January 2019 using the EMBASE (1974-present), Ovid MEDLINE (1946-present), PsychARTICLES, PsychINFO (1806-present), and Global Health (1973-present) databases, via the Ovid Technologies database. Search terms included carer, caregiver, online, technology, internet-based, internet, interactive, intervention, and evaluation. Studies selected for inclusion in this review met the following predetermined criteria: (1) delivering an intervention aimed primarily at informal carers, (2) carers supporting individuals with psychiatric disorders, stroke, dementia, or brain injury, (3) the intervention delivered to the carers was primarily internet based, (4) the study reported a pre- and postquantitative measure of carer depression, anxiety, stress, burden, or quality of life, (5) appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, and (6) was accessible in English. RESULTS: A total of 46 studies were identified for inclusion through the detailed search strategy. The search was conducted, and data were extracted independently by 2 researchers. The majority of studies reported that 1 or more measures relating to carer mental health improved following receipt of a relevant intervention, with interventions for carers of people with traumatic brain injury showing a consistent link with improved outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating internet-based interventions for carers of individuals with diverse psychiatric or neurological difficulties show some evidence in support of the effectiveness of these interventions. In addition, such interventions are acceptable to carers. Available evidence is of varying quality, and more high-quality trials are needed. Further research should also establish how specific intervention components, such as structure or interactivity, contribute to their overall efficacy with regard to carer mental health.",2019,Jul,J Med Internet Res,21,7,e10876,,10.2196/10876,31290399,#8,Spencer 2019
Pubmed,Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Potential to Detect Posttraumatic Neurodegeneration.,Eisele A; Hill-Strathy M; Michels L; Rauen K,"INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most relevant external risk factor for dementia and a major global health burden. Mild TBI (mTBI) contributes to up to 90% of all TBIs, and the classification ""mild"" often misrepresents the patient's burden who suffer from neuropsychiatric long-term sequelae. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows in vivo detection of compromised brain metabolism although it is not routinely used after TBI. OBJECTIVE: Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate if MRS has the potential to identify changes in brain metabolism in adult patients after a single mTBI with a negative routine brain scan (CCT and/or MRI scan) compared to aged- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) during the acute or subacute postinjury phase (â‰_90 days after mTBI). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from the first edition of electronic databases until January 31, 2020. Group analyses were performed per metabolite using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Four and 2 out of 5,417 articles met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and systematic review, respectively. For the meta-analysis, 50 mTBI patients and 51 HC with a mean age of 31 and 30 years, respectively, were scanned using N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a marker for neuronal integrity. Glutamate (Glu), a marker for disturbed brain metabolism, choline (Cho), a marker for increased cell membrane turnover, and creatine (Cr) were used in 2 out of the 4 included articles. Regions of interests were the frontal lobe, the white matter around 1 cm above the lateral ventricles, or the whole brain. NAA was decreased in patients compared to HC with an effect size (ES) of -0.49 (95% CI -1.08 to 0.09), primarily measured in the frontal lobe. Glu was increased in the white matter in 22 mTBI patients compared to 22 HC (ES 0.79; 95% CI 0.17-1.41). Cho was decreased in 31 mTBI patients compared to 31 HC (ES -0.31; 95% CI -0.81 to 0.19). Cr was contradictory and, therefore, potentially not suitable as a reference marker after mTBI. CONCLUSIONS: MRS pinpoints changes in posttraumatic brain metabolism that correlate with cognitive dysfunction and, thus, might possibly help to detect mTBI patients at risk for unfavorable outcome or posttraumatic neurodegeneration early.",2020,Jul,Neurodegener Dis,,,10-Jan,,10.1159/000508098,32610337,#6,Eisele 2020

Embase,Cannflavins â€“ From plant to patient: A scoping review,"Erridge, S.; Mangal, N.; Salazar, O.; Pacchetti, B.; Sodergren, M.H.","Introduction: Cannflavins are a group of prenylflavonoids derived from Cannabis sativa L. Cannflavin A (CFL-A), B (CFL-B) and C (CFL-C) have been heralded for their anti-inflammatory properties in pre-clinical evaluations. This scoping review aims to synthesise the evidence base on cannflavins to provide an overview of the current research landscape to inform research strategies to aid clinical translation. Methods: A scoping review was conducted of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Pubmed, CENTRAL and Google Scholar databases up to 26th February 2020. All studies describing original research on cannflavins and their isomers were included for review. Results: 26 full text articles were included. CFL-A and CFL-B demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity via inhibition of 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induced PGE2 release (CFL-A half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 0.7 Î_M; CFL-B IC50: 0.7 Î_M) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (CFL-A IC50: 1.8 Î_M; CFL-B IC50: 3.7 Î_M). Outcomes were also described in preclinical models of anti-oxidation (CFL-A), anti-parasitic activity (CFL-A, CFL-C), neuroprotection (CFL-A) and cancer (Isocannflavin B, a CFL-B isomer). In-silico screening identified that CFL-A has binding affinity with viral proteins that warrant further investigation. Conclusions: Cannflavins demonstrate a number of promising therapeutic properties, most notably as an anti-inflammatory agent. Low yields of extraction however have previously limited research to small pre-clinical investigations. Identification of cannflavin-rich chemovars, novel extraction techniques and recent identification of a biosynthetic pathway will hopefully allow research to be scaled appropriately. In order to fully evaluate the therapeutic properties of cannflavins focused research now needs to be embedded within institutions with a track-record of clinical translation.",2020,,Fitoterapia,146,"(Erridge S.; Mangal N.; Salazar O.; Sodergren M.H., m.sodergren@imperial.ac.uk) Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, United Kingdom(Pacchetti B.; Sodergren M.H., m.sodergren@imperial.ac.uk) Emmac Life Sciences, London, United Kingdom",,,10.1016/j.fitote.2020.104712,,#734,Erridge 2020

Embase,Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis,"Rerkasem, A.; Orrapin, S.; Howard, D.P.J.; Rerkasem, K.","Background: Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of a Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2017. Objectives: To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke). Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal to October 2019. We also reviewed the reference lists of all relevant studies and abstract books from research proceedings. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carotid artery surgery plus best medical treatment with best medical treatment alone. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. We assessed the results and the quality of the evidence of the primary and secondary outcomes by the GRADE method, which classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. Main results: We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measuring carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke. Using the primary electronic data files, we pooled and analysed individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient-years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials, and redefining outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. Surgery increased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with less than 30% stenosis (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.56; 2 studies, 1746 participants; high-quality evidence). Surgery decreased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; 2 studies, 1429 participants; high-quality evidence), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; 3 studies, 1549 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.67; 3 studies, 1095 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, surgery decreased the five-year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with near-occlusions (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53; 2 studies, 271 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of recurrent stroke for people with significant stenosis. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate-quality evidence) and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis (moderate-quality evidence).",2020,,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2020,9,,,10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub4,,#731,Rerkasem 2020
Embase,Systematic Review of the Diagnostic Validity of Brief Cognitive Screenings for Early Dementia Detection in Spanish-Speaking Adults in Latin America,"Custodio, N.; Duque, L.; Montesinos, R.; Alva-Diaz, C.; Mellado, M.; Slachevsky, A.","Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of brief cognitive screening (BCS) tools designed to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in Spanish-speaking individuals over the age of 50 years from Latin America (LA). Methods: A systematic search of titles and abstracts in Medline, Biomed Central, Embase, Scopus, Scirus, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO was conducted. Inclusion criteria were papers written in English or Spanish involving samples from Spanish-speaking Latin American individuals published until 2018. Standard procedures were applied for reviewing the literature. The data related to the study sample, methodology, and procedures applied, as well as the performance obtained with the corresponding BCS, were collected and systematized. Results: Thirteen of 211 articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies primarily involved memory clinic-based samples, with the exception of two studies from an adult day-care center, one from a primary care clinic, and one from a community-based sample. All the studies originated from five of the 20 countries of LA and all used standardized diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and MCI; however, the diagnostic protocols applied differed. Most studies reported samples with an average of 10 years of education and only one reported a sample with an average of <5 years of education. No publication to date has included an illiterate population. Although the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is the most widely-used BCS tool in LA, it is significantly influenced by education level. Conclusions: Although evidence is still limited, the findings from studies on LA populations suggest that MoCA requires cultural adaptations and different cutoff points according to education level. Moreover, the diagnostic validity of the INECO frontal screening (IFS) test should be evaluated in populations with a low level of education. Given the heterogeneity that exists in the levels of education in LA, more studies involving illiterate and indigenous populations are required.",2020,,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,12,"(Custodio N., ncustodio@ipn.pe; Montesinos R.)

There is thus a critical need to establish biomarkers which can predict the risk of developing AD before the onset of cognitive decline. A number of studies have indicated that exposure to various microbial pathogens can accelerate AD pathology. Additionally, several studies have indicated that amyloid-Î_ possess antimicrobial properties and may act in response to infection as a part of the innate immune system. These findings have led some to speculate that certain types of infections may play a significant role in AD pathogenesis. In this review, we will provide an overview of studies which suggest pathogen involvement in AD. Additionally, we will discuss a number of pathogen-associated biomarkers which may be effective in establishing AD risk. Infections that increase the risk of AD represent a modifiable risk factor which can be treated with therapeutic intervention. Pathogen-based biomarkers may thus be a valuable tool for evaluating and decreasing AD risk across the population.",2020,,Journal of Personalized Medicine,10,3,12-Jan,,10.3390/jpm10030074,,#728,Naughton 2020
Embase,Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea as potential triggers of dementia: is personalized prediction and prevention of the pathological cascade applicable?,"Kitamura, T.; Miyazaki, S.; Sulaiman, H.B.; Akaike, R.; Ito, Y.; Suzuki, H.","Introduction: Sleep disorders ultimately result in sleep deficiency and poor-quality adversely impacts the immune system, glucose metabolism, body weight control, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function, cognitive function, psychological stability, work productivity, quality of life, and social safety. Sleep disorders are very common among the elderly and are often comorbid with other diseases such as dementia, and further accelerating the underlying neurodegenerative processes. Initial studies have not clearly revealed the relationship between sleep disorders and dementia. Nonetheless, recent findings have suggested that insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are closely associated with dementia and perhaps they could be good predictors of occurrence of dementia and optimal treatments for sleep deficiencies may prevent or delay the onset dementia. Methods: Here, we conducted a systematic review based on the criteria of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine on the association of dementia in elderlies with sleep disorder, namely insomnia and OSA. We included 7432 studies and analyzed a total of 14 publications after applying appropriate exclusion criteria. Results: We found that OSA patients had a large tendency to develop and/or experience accelerations of both Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and also vascular dementia, whereas insomnia patients only develop and/or experience accelerations of AD. This may be reflected in the fact that AD and vascular dementia have similar and at the same time also different mechanisms of action. Several studies have also revealed that treating sleep disorders in elderly patients prevented or delayed the onset of dementia, mitigating the progression of symptoms in patients who already manifested dementic symptoms and even reversing neurodegeneration in particular brain areas. Discussion: Currently, the general medical consensus has poorly addressed the role of sleep disorders in exacerbating the risk of dementia. Critically, studies such as the present one emphasizes that the treatment of sleep disorders could be one the preventive measures to evade or to improve dementia symptoms. Additionally, elderly individuals often manifest different sleep deficiency symptoms than younger ones. Given this, an improved age-specific categorization and evaluation methods for sleep deficiency need to be implemented in diagnosing dementia in order to enable personalized assessments and treatments. Collectively, these findings may also assist to improve efforts in predictively detecting and eventually treating dementia.",2020,,EPMA Journal,11,3,355-365,,10.1007/s13167-020-00219-w,,#725,Kitamura 2020
Embase,Skeletal muscle â€“ A bystander or influencer of metabolic syndrome?,"Richter-Stretton, G.L.; Fenning, A.S.; Vella, R.K.","Background and aims: Metabolic syndrome is the concurrent presentation of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It has been suggested that some of these risk factors can have detrimental effects on the skeletal muscle while others can be a direct result of skeletal muscle abnormalities, showing a two-way directionality in the pathogenesis of the condition. This review aims to explore this bidirectional correlation by discussing the impact of metabolic syndrome on skeletal muscle tissue in general and will also discuss ways in which skeletal muscle alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Methods: Literature searches were conducted with key words (e.g. metabolic syndrome, skeletal muscle, hyperglycemia) using PubMed, EBSCOhost, Science Direct and Google Scholar. All article types were included in the search. Results: The pathological mechanisms associated with metabolic syndrome, such as hyperglycemia and inflammation, have been associated with changes in skeletal muscle fiber composition, metabolism, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, and strength. Additionally, some skeletal muscle alterations, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance, are suggested to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. For example, the suggested underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia development are also contributors to metabolic syndrome pathogenesis. Conclusion: Whilst numerous studies have identified a relationship between metabolic syndrome and skeletal muscle abnormalities, further investigation into the underlying mechanisms is needed to elucidate the best prevention and management strategies for these conditions.",2020,,Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews,14,5,867-875,,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.06.006,,#722,Richter-Stretton 2020

Methods: Literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Embase. Keywords used for literature search were â€œfractureâ€ù AND â€œfallâ€ù AND â€œexerciseâ€ù. Randomized controlled trials involving community-dwelling elderlies older than 60 years old with physical exercises as intervention were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. The primary outcomes were falls and fractures. Results: Twelve studies were included and 4784 participants were involved with a mean age of 75.4. The most common exercise interventions were strength and balance exercises. The results of meta-analysis of 11 studies showed that exercise intervention had beneficial effect on fall prevention (RR = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.62â€“0.82; I2 = 24%, p < 0.0001). The effect was better when exercise intervention applied to women participants (RR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.49â€“0.83; I2 = 28%, p = 0.00009) compared to men and women participants (RR = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.64â€“0.89; I2 = 24%, p = 0.001). The results of meta-analysis of seven studies showed that physical exercise had significant effect on fracture prevention (RR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.35â€“0.83; I2 = 25%, p = 0.005). However, the effect was significant when exercise intervention applied to women participants only (RR = 0.37, 95% CI, 0.20â€“0.67; I2 = 0%, p = 0.001) but not significant when exercise intervention applied to both genders (RR = 0.80, 95% CI, 0.58â€“1.09; I2 = 0%, p = 0.15). Conclusion: Exercise interventions, especially the combination of strength and balance training, were effective in preventing falls.

Embase,Review of beneficial effects of resveratrol in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,"Komorowska, J.; WÄ…troba, M.; Szukiewicz, D.","Purpose: The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease is rising, in part due to increase in the medium age of residents in developed countries. The aim of the study has been to determine whether resveratrol (RSV) can be effective in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, providing its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and SIRT1-activating properties. Methods: A systematic review of some experimental and clinical studies has been made. The eligibility criteria have comprised: maximum 10 years passed from the study publication, geographical diversity of the studies performed, and - as much as possible - pertaining of the reviewed study results both to animal models of AD, and to humans. Results: After the final assessment of the eligibility criteria, 96 research studies have been included in the review. Overall results suggest that RSV can be effectively used in the prevention of AD, especially in reference to its familial forms with an early onset. At the same time, efficacy of RSV in the treatment of AD needs further studies, aimed at: improving its transport through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), performing prospective clinical in vivo trials on large groups of patients, and determining the optimal RSV dosage. Discussion: Providing RSV mechanisms of action, inhibitory in reference to many pathomechanisms of AD, it seems very likely that RSV could be effective in AD prevention. The main limitations referring to such presumption include: limited permeability of BBB to RSV, and scarcity of clinical studies on RSV pertaining to large groups of humans.",2020,,Advances in Medical Sciences,65,2,415-423,,10.1016/j.advms.2020.08.002,,#719,Komorowska 2020
Embase,Gene mutations associated with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease in China: An overview and current status,"Qin, Q.; Yin, Y.; Wang, Y.; Lu, Y.; Tang, Y.; Jia, J.","BACKGROUND: Mutations of three causative genes, namely presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP), have been identified as the major causes of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD). The prevalence of causative gene mutations in patients with EOFAD has been reported in previous studies worldwide but remains unclear in China. The patients with these known mutations always show considerable clinical phenotypic variability. However, to date, there have been no detailed descriptions of the clinical phenotypes associated with these Chinese EOFAD mutations. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe all of the known mutations in three EOFAD causative genes and genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese patients with EOFAD. METHOD: We systematically searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, CNKI, VIP, and WAN-FANG databases to find Chinese EOFAD mutations in reports from inception through May 2020. RESULT: We identified 31 studies reporting mutations of three causative genes in China. 10 mutations in APP gene, 27 mutations in PSEN1 gene and six mutations in PSEN2 were discovered in Chinese EOFAD. This review summarized all these probably pathogenic mutations as well as its clinical features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systemic review of causative gene mutations in patients with EOFAD in China. CONCLUSION: The analysis of the genetic and clinical phenotype correlations in this review supports the idea that the clinical phenotype might be influenced by specific genetic defects. It also suggests genetic testing and genotype-phenotype correlations are important for the accurate diagnosis and for understanding disease-associated pathways and might also improve disease therapy and prevention.",2020,,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,,"(Qin Q.; Yin Y.; Wang Y.; Lu Y.; Tang Y.; Jia J.)

Embase,Nicotinamide ribosideâ€”A missing piece in the puzzle of exercise therapy for older adults?,"Custodero, C.; Saini, S.K.; Shin, M.J.; Jeon, Y.K.; Christou, D.D.; McDermott, M.M.; Leeuwenburgh, C.; Anton, S.D.; Mankowski, R.T.","Maintaining physical mobility is important for preventing age-related comorbidities in older adults. Endurance and resistance training prevent mobility loss in aging, but exercise alone does not always achieve the expected improvements in physical and cardiopulmonary function. Recent preclinical evidence suggests that a reason for the variability in exercise training responses may be the age-related dysregulation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolome. NAD+ is an essential enzymatic cofactor in energetic and signaling pathways. Endogenous NAD+ pool is lower in several chronic and degenerative diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, muscular dystrophies), and also in aging. Exercise requires a higher energy expenditure than a resting state, thus a state of NAD+ insufficiency with reduced energy metabolism, could result in an inadequate exercise response. Recently, the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), a vitamin B3 derivate, showed an ability to improve NAD+ metabolome homeostasis, restoring energy metabolism and cellular function in various organs in animals. NR has also been tested in older humans and is considered safe, but the effects of NR supplementation alone on physical performance are unclear. The purpose of this review is to examine the preclinical and clinical evidence on the effect of NR supplementation strategies alone and in combination with physical activity on mobility and skeletal muscle and cardiovascular function.",2020,,Experimental Gerontology,137,"(Custodero C.; Saini S.K.; Shin M.J.; Jeon Y.K.; Leeuwenburgh C.; Anton S.D.; Mankowski R.T., r.mankowski@ufl.edu) Department of Aging and Geriatric Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States(Custodero C.)

Embase,Neuroprotection Against Oxidative Stress: Phytochemicals Targeting TrkB Signaling and the Nrf2-ARE Antioxidant System,"Hannan, M.A.; Dash, R.; Sohag, A.A.M.; Haque, M.N.; Moon, I.S.","Oxidative stress (OS) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of several brain-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke, which are the major causes of dementia. The Nrf2-ARE (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant responsive element antioxidant) system, the primary cellular defense against OS, plays an essential role in neuroprotection by regulating the expressions of antioxidant molecules and enzymes. However, simultaneous events resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deregulation of the Nrf2-ARE system damage essential cell components and cause loss of neuron structural and functional integrity. On the other hand, TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B) signaling, a classical neurotrophin signaling pathway, regulates neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, which play pivotal roles in memory and cognition. Also, TrkB signaling, specifically the TrkB/PI3K/Akt (TrkB/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B) pathway promotes the activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and thus, confers neuroprotection against OS. However, the TrkB signaling pathway is also known to be downregulated in brain disorders due to lack of neurotrophin support. Therefore, activations of TrkB and the Nrf2-ARE signaling system offer a potential approach to the design of novel therapeutic agents for brain disorders. Here, we briefly overview the development of OS and the association between OS and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury. We propose the cellular antioxidant defense and TrkB signaling-mediated cell survival systems be considered pharmacological targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and review the literature on the neuroprotective effects of phytochemicals that can co-activate these neuronal defense systems.",2020,,Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience,13,"(Hannan M.A., hannanbmb@bau.edu.bd; Dash R.; Moon I.S., moonis@dongguk.ac.kr) Department of Anatomy, Dongguk University College of Medicine, Gyeongju, South Korea(Hannan M.A., hannanbmb@bau.edu.bd; Sohag A.A.M.)

Prior stroke is a contributor to CI, but AF is also associated with CI independently from prior stroke. Silent brain infarctions, microemboli and microbleeds, brain atrophy, cerebral hypoperfusion from widely fluctuating ventricular rates, altered hemostatic function, vascular oxidative stress, and inflammation may all exacerbate CI, particularly in patients with persistent/permanent rather than paroxysmal AF and with increased duration/burden of the arrhythmia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging is an important screening tool in eliciting and monitoring vascular and nonvascular lesions contributing to CI. Evidence is also emerging about the role of genetics in CI development. Anticoagulation and rhythm/rate control strategies may protect against CI preventing or slowing its progression or conversion to dementia, particularly at the early stages when CI may still be a treatable condition. Importantly, AF and CI share many common risk factors. Thus, screening for these 2 conditions and searching for and managing modifiable risk factors and potentially reversible causes for both AF and CI remains an important step toward prevention or amelioration of the impact incurred by these 2 conditions.",2020,,Angiology,71,6,498-519,,10.1177/0003319720910669,,#711,Manolis 2020

This systematic review focuses on the use of 11Î_-HSD1 inhibitors in diseases known to be associated with abnormalities in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function. Methods: The databases screened for suitable papers were: MedLine, EMBASE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central. Results: 1925 papers were identified, of which 29 were included in the final narrative synthesis. 11Î_-HSD1 and its inhibitors have been studied in diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Higher expression of 11Î_-HSD1 is seen in obesity and MetS, but has not yet been described in obesity or AD. Genetic studies identify 11Î_-HSD1 SNPs of interest in populations with diabetes, MetS, and AD. One phase II trial successfully reduced HbA1c in a diabetic population, however trials in MetS, obesity, and AD have not met primary endpoints. Conclusions: Translation of this research from preclinical studies has proved challenging so far, however this is a growing area of research and more studies should focus on understanding the complex relationships between 11Î_-HSD1 and disease pathology, especially given the therapeutic potential of 11Î_-HSD1 inhibitors in development.",2020,,Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental,108,"(Gregory S., Sarah.Gregory@ed.ac.uk; Hill D.; Grey B.; Muniz-Terrera G.; Ritchie C.W.)

We aimed to capture the breadth of outcomes that have been associated with the presence of OH and systematically assess the quality, strength and credibility of these associations using an umbrella review with integrated meta-analyses. Methods: We systematically searched several major databases from their commencements through to 16th May 2019 for meta-analyses of observational studies of OH and any health-related outcome. We used these metrics to categorize the strength of evidence of significant outcomes (p < 0.05) from class I (convincing) to class IV (weak), according to the pre-established criteria. Results: From 975 abstracts, seven meta-analyses of 12 outcomes were included. For each outcome, the median number of studies was four, and the median number of participants was 46,493, with a median of 3630 incident cases. There was suggestive (class III) evidence that OH was associated with significantly higher risk of coronary heart disease (HR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.12â€“1.56), stroke (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.08â€“1.38), congestive heart failure (HR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.09â€“1.55), all-cause mortality (RR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.24â€“1.81), falls (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.39â€“2.44), and dementia (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.11â€“1.35). Conclusion: The current evidence base indicates that OH is significantly associated with a range of adverse cardiovascular, cognitive, and mortality outcomes in older people, although the strength of this evidence remains only suggestive.

Embase,"Review of Gait, Cognition, and Fall Risks with Implications for Fall Prevention in Older Adults with Dementia","Zhang, W.; Low, L.-F.; Schwenk, M.; Mills, N.; Gwynn, J.D.; Clemson, L.","Background: Older people with cognitive impairment are at increased risk of falls; however, fall prevention strategies have limited success in this population. The aim of this paper is to review the literature to inform a theoretical framework for fall prevention in older adults with dementia. Summary: A narrative review was conducted on fall risk factors in people with cognitive impairment, the relationship between cognition and gait, and their joint impact on the risk of falls. This was used to develop a theoretical framework for fall prevention for people with dementia. Executive function and motor function are closely related as they share neuroanatomy. This close relationship has been confirmed by observational studies including neuroimaging and intervention studies. Executive function is the cognitive domain most commonly associated with gait dysfunction. Attention, sensory integration, and motor planning are the sub-domains of executive function associated with risk of falls through gait dysfunction, whereas cognitive flexibility, judgement, and inhibitory control affect risk of falls through risk-taking behaviour. Key Messages: Gait, cognition, and falls are closely related. The comorbidity and interaction between gait abnormality and cognitive impairment may underpin the high prevalence of falls in older adults with dementia. Gait assessment and cognitive assessment, particularly executive function, should be integrated in fall risk screening. Assessment results should be interpreted and utilised using a multidisciplinary approach; specific strategies such as customised gait training and behavioural modulation should be considered as part of falls prevention for people with dementia.",2019,,Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders,48,2-Jan,17-29,,10.1159/000504340,,#595,Zhang 2019

Relevant literature was identified by examining reference lists for previous reviews and primary studies, and searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Research Gate. Sixty-eight identified reports, published between 1982 and August 2018, met inclusion criteria. Common methodological weaknesses included self-reported TBI (62%); poor TBI case definition (55%); low prevalence of TBI in samples (range 0.07-28.7%); reverse causality (86% moderate to high risk of reverse causality); not controlling for important confounding factors. There were also key areas of methodological rigor including use of individual matching for cases and controls (57%); gold standard dementia and AD criteria (53%); symmetrical data collection (65%); large sample sizes (max, 2,794,752); long follow-up periods and controlling of analyses for age (82%). The quality assessment revealed methodological problems with most studies. Overall, only one study was identified as having strong methodological rigor. This critical review identified several key areas of methodological weakness and rigor and should be used as a guideline for improving future research.

Embase,Could Animal-Assisted Therapy Help to Reduce Coercive Treatment in Psychiatry?,"Widmayer, S.; Borgwardt, S.; Lang, U.E.; Huber, C.G.","For psychiatric patients, compulsory admission and coercive measures can constitute distressing and sometimes traumatizing experiences. As a consequence, clinicians aim at minimizing such procedures. At the same time, they need to ensure high levels of safety for patients, staff and the public. In order to prevent compulsory measures and to favor the use of less restrictive alternatives, innovative interventions improving the management of dangerous situations are needed. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is being applied in a variety of diagnoses and treatment settings, and could have the potential to reduce aggression and psychopathology. Therefore, AAT might be of use in the prevention and early treatment of aggression, and might constitute a promising component of treatment alternatives to forced interventions. To our knowledge, no study evaluating the effect of AAT on compulsory measures in persons with psychiatric diseases has been published up to date. This narrative expert review including a systematic literature search examines the published literature about the use of AAT in psychiatry. Studies report reduced anxiety and aggressiveness as well as positive effects on general wellbeing, self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness. Although literature on the applicability of AAT as a component of preventive or de-escalating treatment settings is sparse, beneficial effects of AAT have been reported.

Embase,Emerging Cognitive Intervention Technologies to Meet the Needs of an Aging Population: A Systematic Review,"Alnajjar, F.; Khalid, S.; Vogan, A.A.; Shimoda, S.; Nouchi, R.; Kawashima, R.","Background: Cognitive training helps to promote healthy aging and ease activities of daily living for older adults. Recently, experiments have been conducted using robots to perform this cognitive training. Methods: A review was conducted to examine the effects of computer-based cognitive interventions for older adults who were either healthy or experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A second study also examined the evolution of socially assistive robots (SAR) and their effectiveness at administering cognitive training for older adults. Results: Eighty-one studies published between 2009 and 2019 were identified for review, 56 of which focused on computerized cognitive training (CCT) while 25 examined the use of robotics. Twenty-four of the 56 CCT studies met the inclusion criteria. These were further classified into two groups: studies which used self-designed programs, and studies using commercially available ones. Of the 25 studies examining the use of robotics in cognitive intervention 7 met the inclusion criteria. Review shows that CCT improves cognitive function but that robots are more effective tools for improving cognition. Conclusion: It can be concluded that CCT is beneficial for older adults and though there are drawbacks to this approach they are overcome by the introduction of robots into the training process. Culture, language, and socio-economic considerations vis-a-vis robot design and training methodology should be included in future research.",2019,,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,11,"(Alnajjar F., fady.alnajjar@uaeu.ac.ae; Khalid S.; Vogan A.A.)

Embase,"Nardostachys chinensis Batalin: A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology","Rehman, T.; Ahmad, S.","Nardostachys chinensis Batalin (Valerianaceae) has been widely used in different traditional systems of medicine, including Islamic, Ayurvedic, Chinese, and Korean folk medicine. It has been used in traditional medicine as a tranquilizer, hepatotonic, cardiotonic, diuretic, and analgesic. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies have provided valuable scientific evidence for its traditional uses. This review aims to summarize reported traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological potential of N.Â chinensis while identifying potential areas of further research of plant. The review comprises literature pertaining to the pharmacological potential and phytochemistry of N.Â chinensis using worldwide accepted scientific databases via electronic search (Elsevier, Google Scholar, Pub Med, Scopus, Springer, Wiley online library). Moreover, data from ethno botanical text books available in library and electronic search were also included. The Plant List and Kew Herbarium Catalogue databases were used to authenticate the scientific name. Different pharmacological experiments in many in vitro and in vivo models have proved the potential of N.Â chinensis, namely, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antibacterial, antihypertensive, antifungal, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, aldose reductase inhibition, and antioxidant activities. The plant contains sesquiterpenenes of various varieties including aristolane, guaiane, and nardosinane types. Moreover, it also contains coumarins, phenols, lignans, neolignans, and glycosides. Reported activities suggested that there may be pharmacological potential for developing N.Â chinensis as a drug for infections, hypertension, cardiac diseases, Alzheimer's disease, insomnia, epilepsy, cancer, gastric, and liver diseases. More toxicological studies should be performed that will aid the progress to clinical trial studies of N.Â chinensis.",2019,,Phytotherapy Research,33,10,2622-2648,,10.1002/ptr.6447,,#582,Rehman 2019
Embase,The Effects of Tai Chi Mind-Body Approach on the Mechanisms of Gulf War Illness: an Umbrella Review,"Reid, K.F.; Bannuru, R.R.; Wang, C.; Mori, D.L.; Niles, B.L.","Gulf War illness (GWI) is a chronic and multisymptom disorder affecting military veterans deployed to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. It is characterized by a range of acute and chronic symptoms, including but not limited to, fatigue, sleep disturbances, psychological problems, cognitive deficits, widespread pain, and respiratory and gastrointestinal difficulties. The prevalence of many of these chronic symptoms affecting Gulf War veterans occur at markedly elevated rates compared to nondeployed contemporary veterans. To date, no effective treatments for GWI have been identified. The overarching goal of this umbrella review was to critically evaluate the evidence for the potential of Tai Chi mind-body exercise to benefit and alleviate GWI symptomology. Based on the most prevalent GWI chronic symptoms and case definitions established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Kansas Gulf War Veterans Health Initiative Program, we reviewed and summarized the evidence from 7 published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Our findings suggest that Tai Chi may have the potential for distinct therapeutic benefits on the major prevalent symptoms of GWI. Future clinical trials are warranted to examine the feasibility, efficacy, durability and potential mechanisms of Tai Chi for improving health outcomes and relieving symptomology in GWI.",2019,,Integrative Medicine Research,8,3,167-172,,10.1016/j.imr.2019.05.003,,#581,Reid 2019

Embase,Epigenetics and depression: An update,"Lin, E.; Tsai, S.-J.","Objective Depression is associated with various environmental risk factors such as stress, childhood maltreatment experiences, and stressful life events. Current approaches to assess the pathophysiology of depression, such as epigenetics and gene-environment (GxE) interactions, have been widely leveraged to determine plausible markers, genes, and variants for the risk of developing depression. Methods We focus on the most recent developments for genomic research in epigenetics and GxE interactions. Results In this review, we first survey a variety of association studies regarding depression with consideration of GxE interactions. We then illustrate evidence of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, microRNAs, and histone modifications to influence depression in terms of animal models and human studies. Finally, we highlight their limitations and future directions. Conclusion In light of emerging technologies in artificial intelligence and machine learning, future research in epigenetics and GxE interactions promises to achieve novel innovations that may lead to disease prevention and future potential therapeutic treatments for depression.",2019,,Psychiatry Investigation,16,9,654-661,,10.30773/pi.2019.07.17.2,,#579,Lin 2019

Multidomain lifestyle interventions are increasingly being studied as a non-pharmacological solution to enhance cognitive reserve, maintain cognition, and reduce the risk of or delay ADRD. Review of completed and prospective face-to-face (FTF) and digital multidomain interventions provides an opportunity to compare studies and informs future interventions and study design. Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov and NIH RePORTER) were searched for multidomain lifestyle programs. Studies were included if the program (1) included a control group, (2) included at least 3 interventions, (3) were at least 6 months in duration, and (4) included measurement of cognitive performance as an outcome. Results: In total, 17 multidomain lifestyle programs aimed at enhancing cognitive reserve and reducing risk of ADRD were found. Thirteen programs are FTF in intervention delivery, with 3 FTF programs replicating the FINGER protocol as part of the World Wide Fingers Consortium. Four programs are delivered digitally (website, Web application, or mobile app). Program characteristics (e.g., target population, duration, frequency, outcomes, and availability) and results of completed and prospective studies are reviewed and discussed. Conclusion: This review updates and discusses completed and current multidomain lifestyle interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive reserve and reducing risk of ADRD. A growing number of international studies are investigating the efficacy and utility of these programs in both FTF and digital contexts. While a diversity of study designs and interventions exist, FTF and digital programs that build upon the foundational work of the FINGER protocol have significant potential to enhance cognitive reserve and reduce risk of ADRD.",2019,,Nutrients,11,9,,,10.3390/nu11092258,,#578,Bott 2019

Increased double support time and step length variability were associated with recurrent falls. The reviewed articles do not support using the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment and the Timed Up-and-Go tests to predict any fall in this population. There is limited research on the use of dual-task gait assessments for predicting falls in people with dementia.Conclusion: This systematic review shows the specific spatiotemporal gait parameters and features that are associated with falls in people with dementia.

Managing fecal incontinence can be challenging for both residents and care staff. We conducted this review to describe the prevalence, incidence, and correlates of fecal incontinence among care home residents. Design: Systematic literature review. Setting and participants: Older care home residents (both nursing and residential care) aged 60 years and older. Measures: We defined double incontinence as the presence of fecal plus urinary incontinence, isolated fecal incontinence as fecal incontinence with no urinary incontinence, and all fecal incontinence as anyone with fecal incontinence (whether isolated or double). The CINAHL and MEDLINE databases were searched up to December 31, 2017, to retrieve all studies reporting the prevalence and/or incidence and correlates of fecal incontinence. Results: We identified 278 citations after removing duplicates, and 23 articles met the inclusion criteria. There were 12 high-quality studies, 5 medium-quality studies, and 6 low-quality studies. The medians for prevalence (as reported by the studies) of isolated fecal incontinence, double incontinence, and all fecal incontinence were 3.5% [interquartile range (IQR) = 2.8%], 47.1% (IQR = 32.1%), and 42.8% (IQR = 21.1%), respectively. The most frequently reported correlates of fecal incontinence were cognitive impairment, limited functional capacity, urinary incontinence, reduced mobility, advanced age, and diarrhea.

Embase,On the central role of mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress in Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"Tobore, T.O.","Background: Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia, with approximately 5 million new cases occurring annually. Despite decades of research, its complex pathophysiology and etiopathogenesis presents a major hindrance to the development of an effective treatment and prevention strategy. Aging is the biggest risk factor for the development of AD, and the total number of older people in the population is going to significantly increase in the next decades, suggesting that AD incidence and prevalence is likely to increase in the future. This makes the need for a better understanding of the disease to be extremely urgent. Methods: A search was done by accessing PubMed/Medline, EBSCO, and PsycINFO databases. The search string used was â€œ(dementia* OR Alzheimerâ€™s) AND (pathophysiology* OR pathogenesis)â€ù. New key terms were identified (new term included â€œvitamin D, thyroid hormone, mitochondria dysfunction, oxidative stress, testosterone, estrogen, melatonin, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, amyloid-Î_ (AÎ_), and hyperphosphorylated tauâ€ù). The electronic databases were searched for titles or abstracts containing these terms in all published articles between January 1, 1965, and January 31, 2019.

There is no consensus as to which cognitive screening instrument (CSI) is most suitable for VCI. We systematically reviewed the psychometric properties of brief CSIs for vascular mild cognitive impairment (VMCI) and vascular dementia (VaD). Methods: Literature searches were performed using scholarly databases from inception until 31 May 2018. Studies were eligible if participants were aged 18 or older, interviewed face-to-face, and standard diagnostic criteria for VCI were applied, excluding those specifically identifying post-stroke dementia. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Results: Fifteen studies were identified including eight types of CSIs (27 subtests/variants) and 4575 participants (1015 with VCI), mean age range: 51.6 to 75.5Â years. Most studies compared more than one instrument. Five papers examined clock-drawing; four, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); and three used the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET). The MoCA (AUCÂ >Â 0.90) and MMSE (AUC: 0.86-0.99) had excellent accuracy in differentiating VaD from controls; the MoCA had good internal consistency (Cronbach's Î±:.83-.88). The MoCA (AUC: 0.87-0.93) and BMET (AUC: 0.94) had the greatest accuracy in separating VMCI from controls. Most studies had low to moderate risk of bias in all domains of the QUIPS.

It is crucial to identify early predictors of depression among adolescents and young people to effectively target prevention. A gap in the literature is a comprehensive systematic review of predictors of depression among adolescents around the globe, especially in low- and middle-income countries LMICs. This review aims to identify evidence for biological, psychological, and contextual risk factors for the development of depression among adolescents and young adults (10-24 years of age) in high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs, ultimately contributing to (a) identification of potential mechanisms underlying depression development, (b) selection of common risk and protective factors as targets for detection, and (c) refinement of risk models that can be evaluated through existing cohorts in HICs and LMICs. Methods: This review will follow the Population, Exposure, Comparison, Outcome (PI(E)CO) model and adheres to the PRISMA-P guidelines. A search strategy was developed by a multidisciplinary research consortium. Seven databases (MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Lilacs, African Journals Online, Global Health) will be searched to identify articles. Independent raters will screen and retrieve articles for inclusion, conduct quality ratings, and extract data. The Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research adapted for Cultural Psychiatry Epidemiology (SAQOR-CPE) will be used to assess quality of observational studies. We will assess for publication bias using funnel plots and statistical methods. We will use narrative synthesis to present results, addressing the study's objectives following the Cochrane Handbook guidelines. Meta-analyses will be used to report summary statistics for association of risk factors with development of depression.

Embase,Building your best day for healthy brain agingâ€”The neuroprotective effects of optimal time use,"Mellow, M.L.; Dumuid, D.; Thacker, J.S.; Dorrian, J.; Smith, A.E.","As the number of older people increases, so too does the prevalence of neurodegenerative disease. Worldwide, health organisations have identified the need for practical, affordable interventions to slow or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, for which there are multiple modifiable risk factors. The effects of various interventions on brain health has been investigated, including achieving sufficient physical activity, getting appropriate amounts and quality of sleep, and limiting sedentary behaviours. Few of these studies, though, have taken into account more than one lifestyle behaviour within a single study. Epidemiologists have recently initiated a paradigm shift to move away from studying the independent effects of each physical activity, sleep and sedentary behaviour, and towards an integrated 24-h time-use paradigm. Time is finite, and thus to increase time in one activity (for example physical activity), equal time must be taken away from other activities (sleep and sedentary behaviour). This 24-h time-use paradigm has begun to be used when studying obesity, adiposity and quality of life; however, to the authorsâ€™ knowledge, it has not yet been adopted by cognitive neuroscientists for the study of cognition or brain function. This narrative review synthesises the evidence for the neurophysiological effects of physical activity, sleep and sedentary behaviour independently, with a particular focus on brain structure, function and neurodegenerative disease risk.

Embase,Hormetic effects of curcumin: What is the evidence?,"Moghaddam, N.S.A.; Oskouie, M.N.; Butler, A.E.; Petit, P.X.; Barreto, G.E.; Sahebkar, A.","Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the yellow powder prepared from the roots of Curcuma longa or Zingiberaceae (known as turmeric) is not only widely used to color and flavor food but also used as a pharmaceutical agent. Curcumin demonstrates anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antiaging, and antioxidant activity, as well as efficacy in wound healing. Notably, curcumin is a hormetic agent (hormetin), as it is stimulatory at low doses and inhibitory at high doses. Hormesis by curcumin could be also a particular function at low doses (i.e., antioxidant behavior) and another function at high dose (i.e., induction of autophagy and cell death). Recent findings suggest that curcumin exhibits biphasic doseâ€“responses on cells, with low doses having stronger effects than high doses; examples being activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway or antioxidant activity. This indicates that many effects induced by curcumin are dependent on dose and some effects might be greater at lower doses, indicative of a hormetic response. Despite the consistent occurrence of hormetic responses of curcumin in a wide range of biomedical models, epidemiological and clinical trials are needed to assess the nature of curcuminâ€™s doseâ€“response in humans. Fortunately, more than one hundred clinical trials with curcumin and curcumin derivatives are ongoing. In this review, we provide the first comprehensive analysis supportive of the hormetic behavior of curcumin and curcumin derivatives.",2019,,Journal of Cellular Physiology,234,7,10060-10071,,10.1002/jcp.27880,,#560,Moghaddam 2019
Embase,Dietary Fat Intake and Cognitive Function among Older Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Cao, G.-Y.; Li, M.; Han, L.; Tayie, F.; Yao, S.-S.; Huang, Z.; Ai, P.; Liu, Y.-Z.; Hu, Y.-H.; Xu, B.","Objective: The associations between dietary fat intake and cognitive function are inconsistent and inconclusive. This study aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of prospective cohort studies on the relationship between dietary fat intake and cognitive function among older adults. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched for prospective cohort studies published in English before March 2018 reporting cognitive outcomes in relation to dietary fat intake. Four binary incident outcomes included were mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. The categories of dietary fat intake were based on fat consumption or the percentage of energy from fat consumption, including dichotomies, tertiles, quartiles and quintiles. The relative risk (RR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was pooled using a random effects model. Results: Nine studies covering a total of 23,402 participants were included. Compared with the lowest category of consumption, the highest category of saturated fat intake was associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment (RR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.02-1.91) and AD (RR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.09-3.20). The total and unsaturated fat intake was not statistically associated with cognitive outcomes with significant betweenstudy heterogeneity. Conclusion: This study reported a detrimental association between saturated fat intake and cognitive impairment and mixed results between unsaturated fat intake and selected cognitive outcomes. Given the substantial heterogeneity in the sample size and methodology used across studies, the evidence presented here should be interpreted with caution.",2019,,Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,6,3,204-211,,10.14283/jpad.2019.9,,#559,Cao 2019
Embase,Antipsychotic drug use and risk of stroke and myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zivkovic, S.; Koh, C.H.; Kaza, N.; Jackson, C.A.","Background: The effect of antipsychotic (AP) drugs on risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) remains unclear due to methodological limitations of, and inconsistencies across, existing studies. We aimed to systematically review studies reporting on the associations between AP drug use and stroke or MI risk, and to investigate whether associations differed among different sub-populations. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library (from inception to May 28, 2017) for observational studies reporting on AP drug use and MI or stroke occurrence. We performed random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome, performing sub-groups analyses by study population - specifically general population (i.e. those not restricted to patients with a particular indication for AP drug use), people with dementia only and psychiatric illness only. Where feasible we performed subgroup analyses by AP drug class. Results: From 7008 articles, we included 29 relevant observational studies, 19 on stroke and 10 on MI. Results of cohort studies that included a general population indicated a more than two-fold increased risk of stroke, albeit with substantial heterogeneity (pooled HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.13, 4.74, I2 = 83.2%). However, the risk among patients with dementia was much lower, with no heterogeneity (pooled HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00, 1.33, I2 = 0%) and there was no clear association among studies of psychiatric populations (pooled HR 1.44, 95% CI 0.90, 2.30; substantial heterogeneity [I2 = 78.8])). Associations generally persisted when stratifying by AP class, but few studies reported on first generation AP drugs. We found no association between AP drug use and MI risk (pooled HR for cohort studies: 1.29, 95% CI 0.88, 1.90 and case-control studies: 1.07, 95% CI 0.94, 1.23), but substantial methodological and statistical heterogeneity among a relatively small number of studies limits firm conclusions. Conclusions: AP drug use may be associated with an increased risk of stroke, but there is no clear evidence that this risk is further elevated in patients with dementia. Further studies are need to clarify the effect of AP drug use on MI and stroke risk in different sub-populations and should control for confounding by indication and stratify by AP drug class.",2019,,BMC Psychiatry,19,1,,,10.1186/s12888-019-2177-5,,#558,Zivkovic 2019
Embase,CNS small vessel disease: A clinical review,"Cannistraro, R.J.; Badi, M.; Eidelman, B.H.; Dickson, D.W.; Middlebrooks, E.H.; Meschia, J.F.","CNS small vessel disease (CSVD) causes 25% of strokes and contributes to 45% of dementia cases. Prevalence increases with age, affecting about 5% of people aged 50 years to almost 100% of people older than 90 years. Known causes and risk factors include age, hypertension, branch atheromatous disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, radiation exposure, immune-mediated vasculitides, certain infections, and several genetic diseases. CSVD can be asymptomatic; however, depending on location, lesions can cause mild cognitive dysfunction, dementia, mood disorders, motor and gait dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. CSVD is diagnosed on the basis of brain imaging biomarkers, including recent small subcortical infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and cerebral atrophy. Advanced imaging modalities can detect signs of disease even earlier than current standard imaging techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging can identify altered white matter connectivity, and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging can identify decreased vascular reactivity. Pathogenesis is thought to begin with an etiologically specific insult, with or without genetic predisposition, which results in dysfunction of the neurovascular unit. Uncertainties regarding pathogenesis have delayed development of effective treatment. The most widely accepted approach to treatment is to intensively control well-established vascular risk factors, of which hypertension is the most important. With better understanding of pathogenesis, specific therapies may emerge. Early identification of pathologic characteristics with advanced imaging provides an opportunity to forestall progression before emergence of symptoms.",2019,,Neurology,92,24,1146-1156,,10.1212/WNL.0000000000007654,,#557,Cannistraro 2019

Embase,Can cognitive leisure activity prevent cognitive decline in older adults? A systematic review of intervention studies,"Iizuka, A.; Suzuki, H.; Ogawa, S.; Kobayashi-Cuya, K.E.; Kobayashi, M.; Takebayashi, T.; Fujiwara, Y.","The aims of this systematic review were to investigate what kind of cognitive leisure activities have been used in intervention studies targeting older adults, and whether these activities improve cognitive function or inhibit cognitive decline. Based on the PRISMA declaration, we searched keywords using three electronic databases: PubMed, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES. Intervention studies involving cognitive leisure activities with cognitive assessments set as outcomes were included. We regarded cognitive leisure activities as activities for enjoyment or well-being that cause intellectual stimulation (e.g. reading, playing board games). To investigate the influence of each activity on cognitive domains, multicomponent programs (e.g. combined music and art) were excluded. In total, 20 studies were included in the evaluation. Consequently, intervention studies related to arts, writing, board games, reading, handicrafts, a crossword puzzle and learning computer skills were identified. Of the 20 studies, 13 showed improvement in some cognitive domain. In 12 of these 13 studies, the intervention effects were not observed in a specific cognitive domain; rather, the intervention effects were observed across multiple cognitive domains and on working memory. The results of the present review suggest that cognitive function in older adults can be improved through cognitive leisure activity interventions. Activities related to learning new skills, that cause strong intellectual stimulation and that include communication elements were considered particularly effective tools. However, as the number of studies is small, more high-quality research needs to be accumulated.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Psychinfo, Health Business Elite and Health Management Information Consortium for randomized studies of vasodilating medications, compared to no treatment or nonvasodilators, that reported effects on cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean blood flow velocity (MFV) or cerebrovascular reactivity. Absolute and standardized mean differences (SMD) were combined by inverse-variance weighted fixed or random-effects meta-analysis stratified by study design, population characteristics and vasodilator class. Results: In 35 studies reporting 57 comparisons, there was a reduction in SBP (-4.13 mmHg, -7.55 to -0.71, P=0.018) but no change in MFV (Î”MFV 1.11, confidence interval -0.93 to 3.14, P=0.29, 23 comparisons).

Embase,Management of hypoglycemia in older adults with type 2 diabetes,"Freeman, J.","Treatment of older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is complex because they represent a heterogeneous group with a broad range of comorbidities, functional abilities, socioeconomic status, and life expectancy. Older adults with T2D are at high risk of recurring hypoglycemia, a condition associated with marked morbidity and mortality, because their counter-regulatory mechanism to hypoglycemia is attenuated, and recurring hypoglycemic episodes can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness. In addition, polypharmacy, a result of multiple chronic comorbidities (including heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease), can increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia, especially when patients are taking sulfonylureas or insulin. Often the signs of hypoglycemia are nonspecific (sweating, dizziness, confusion, visual disturbances) and are mistaken for neurological symptoms or dementia. Consequences of hypoglycemia include acute and long-term cognitive changes, cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, serious falls, frailty, and death, often resulting in hospitalization, which come at a high economic cost. The American Diabetes Association has recently added three new recommendations regarding hypoglycemia in the elderly, highlighting individualized pharmacotherapy with glucose-lowering agents with a low risk of hypoglycemia and proven cardiovascular safety, avoidance of overtreatment, and simplifying treatment regimens while maintaining HbA1c targets. Thus, glycemic goals can be relaxed in the older population as part of individualized care, and physicians must make treatment decisions that best serve their patientsâ€™ circumstances. This article highlights the issues faced by older people with T2D, the risk factors for hypoglycemia in this population, and the challenges faced by health care providers regarding glycemic management in this patient group.",2019,,Postgraduate Medicine,131,4,241-250,,10.1080/00325481.2019.1578590,,#549,Freeman 2019

In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze the neuroprotective role of GLP-1 and its defined mechanisms. Methods: We searched â€˜Web of Scienceâ€™ and â€˜Pubmedâ€™ to identify relevant studies using GLP-1 as the keyword. Two hundred and eighty-nine clinical and preclinical studies have been included. Data have been presented by grouping neurodegenerative, neurovascular and specific cell culture models. Results: Recent literature shows that GLP-1 and its agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors and combined GLP-1/GIP molecules are effective in partially or fully reversing the effects of neurotoxic compounds, neurovascular complications of diabetes, neuropathological changes related with Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease or vascular occlusion. Possible mechanisms that provide neuroprotection are enhancing the viability of the neurons and restoring neurite outgrowth by increased neurotrophic factors, increasing subventricular zone progenitor cells, decreasing apoptosis, decreasing the level of pro-inflammatory factors, and strengthening blood-brain barrier.

We searched for meta-analyses of observational studies reporting on the association of telomere length with any health outcome (clinical disease outcomes and intermediate traits). For each association, random-effects summary effect size, 95% confidence interval (CI), and 95% prediction interval were calculated. To evaluate the credibility of the identified evidence, we assessed also heterogeneity, evidence for small-study effect and evidence for excess significance bias. Twenty-one relevant meta-analyses were identified reporting on 50 different outcomes. The level of evidence was high only for the association of short telomeres with higher risk of gastric cancer in the general population (relative risk, RR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.68â€“2.26), and moderate for the association of shorter telomeres with diabetes or with Alzheimer's disease, even if limited to meta-analyses of case-control studies. There was weak evidence for twenty outcomes and not significant association for 27 health outcomes. The present umbrella review demonstrates that shorter telomere length may have an important role in incidence gastric cancer and, probably, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.

However, despite its prevalence, the magnitude of this phenomenon as well as its predictors and etiology are still poorly understood. Methods: We performed the first systematic review of all the studies published between March 1993 and December 2018 which investigated HD patients and gene carriers that reported suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or suicide as an outcome. Results: This review reveals that some aspects of suicidality in HD are more clearly understood than others. We confirm an increased risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide for HD patients. We found that suicidal ideation is elevated throughout the course of the disease, and that psychiatric comorbidities are common risk factors with depression being the most prominent. Limitations: Important data are still largely missing, specifically regarding cognitive and neuroanatomical mechanisms and potential effective interventions. Moreover, inconsistencies in terminology, assessment tools, and outcome measures limit the comparability of the research and the conclusions that can be drawn. Conclusions: Incidence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide are higher among those with HD relative to the non-HD population. It is therefore important that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are closely monitored in HD clinics and that clinical trials use standardized scales. Future research should focus on better understanding the etiology of this high suicide risk and on testing the efficacy of potential interventions.",2019,,Journal of Affective Disorders,250,"(Kachian Z.R.; Cohen-Zimerman S., scohenzime@sralab.org; Grafman J.)

In most cases, CSVD is only recognized in its advanced stages once its symptomatic sequelae develop. However, its significance in asymptomatic healthy populations remains poorly defined. In population-based studies of presumed healthy elderly individuals, CSVD neuroimaging markers including white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, cortical superficial siderosis, and cerebral microinfarcts are frequently detected. While the presence of these imaging markers may reflect unique mechanisms at play, there are likely shared pathways underlying CSVD. Herein, we aim to assess the etiology and significance of these individual biomarkers by focusing in asymptomatic populations at an epidemiological level. By primarily examining population-based studies, we explore the risk factors that are involved in the formation and progression of these biomarkers. Through a critical semi-systematic review, we aim to characterize â€œasymptomaticâ€ù CSVD, review screening modalities, and draw associations from observational studies in clinical populations.

Embase,Effect of Vitamin B Supplementation on Cognitive Function in the Elderly: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Ford, A.H.; Almeida, O.P.","Background: Vitamin B deficiency and elevated total plasma homocysteine have been associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in later life, although it is unknown if treatment with these vitamins improves cognitive outcomes. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy of treatment with vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or folic acid in slowing cognitive decline amongst older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Methods: We summarized findings from previous systematic reviews of clinical trials and performed a new systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 English-language, randomized placebo-controlled trials of B-vitamin supplementation of individuals with and without existing cognitive impairment. Results: Previous reviews have generally reported no effect of B vitamins on cognitive function in older adults with or without cognitive impairment at study entry, although these vitamins effectively lowered total plasma homocysteine levels in participants. Ten randomized placebo-controlled trials of 1925 participants with pre-existing cognitive impairment and 21 trials of 15,104 participants without cognitive impairment have been completed to date but these generally confirmed findings from previous reviews with the exception of two trials that showed a modest but clinically uncertain benefit for vitamins in people with elevated plasma homocysteine. B-vitamin supplementation did not show an improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination scores for individuals with (mean difference 0.16, 95% confidence interval âˆ’ 0.18 to 0.51) and without (mean difference 0.04, 95% confidence interval âˆ’ 0.10 to 0.18) cognitive impairment compared to placebo. Conclusions: Raised total plasma homocysteine is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, although available evidence from randomized controlled trials shows no obvious cognitive benefit of lowering homocysteine using B vitamins. Existing trials vary greatly in the type of supplementation, population sampled, study quality, and duration of treatment, thereby making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from existing data. Findings should therefore be viewed in the context of the limitations of the available data and the lack of evidence of effect should not necessarily be interpreted as evidence of no effect.",2019,,Drugs and Aging,36,5,419-434,,10.1007/s40266-019-00649-w,,#540,Ford 2019

Despite this, elderly patients are currently being prescribed a median of 7 medications, which often causes more harm than benefit, and emphasizes the importance of deprescribing. methods: Five classes of potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly population, especially for the aging brain, are discussed, including anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, opioids, and pro-ton pump inhibitors. Recommendations regarding these medications were collected from the 2015 Beer's Criteria, the Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, the Screening Tool to Alert doctors to the Right Treatment (START) criteria, and the Fit fOR The Aged (PORTA) list. The PubMed database was also searched for the most recent evidence regarding prescription patterns, adverse effects, and recommendations regarding discontinuation of these medications in older adults. results: Anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and opioids were all found to have significant adverse effects in the elderly population. All of the discussed medication classes have been shown to be successfully deprescribable. conclusions: Polypharmacy increases the risk of adverse drug reactions and hospitalizations in geriatric patients.

AF has been correlated with silent lesions and cognitive impairment, even in the absence of stroke. The cognitive impairment in AF represents a risk of functional decline, morbidity, mortality and high costs, constituting a public health problem due to the increasing prevalence of this arrhythmia. Cognitive analysis of patients with AF without stroke has shown poor performance in executive, memory and learning functions. The greater loss occurs in speed processing and performance of instrumental tasks leading to functional dependence. Neuroimaging studies have shown both structural and functional abnormalities in individuals with AF even in the absence of cognitive impairment.

The scientific basis for claiming that body movements may indicate pain has not formerly been investigated in a systematic review. The objective was to explore research evidence for body movements being pain indicators in older people with cognitive impairment.

Two researchers independently identified and consented on studies to be included. PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews was followed. Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for critical evaluation of study quality. Results: A total of 2,096 records from the literature searches were identified, and 17 quantitative and eight qualitative studies were included in the review, the studies mainly related to older people with dementia. Quality scores ranged from 50% to 100%. We combined 62 items of body movements into 13 similar or synonymous items, and criteria for evidence were defined. Strong evidence was found for restlessness (agitation), rubbing, guarding, rigidity and physical aggression as the behaviours frequently responded (increased or decreased) to pain provoking activities, painful procedures and/or pain medication. Conclusions: Among 13 categories of body movements, we found five with strong and five with moderate evidence of validity. As few items were typically included in many studies reflecting criterion validity, all should be included in future studies of patients with different characteristics, location and duration of pain.

Embase,Factors associated with Alzheimer's disease: An overview of reviews,"Rochoy, M.; Rivas, V.; Chazard, E.; Decarpentry, E.; Saudemont, G.; Hazard, P.-A.; Puisieux, F.; Gautier, S.; Bordet, R.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a frequent pathology, with a poor prognosis, for which no curative treatment is available in 2018. AD prevention is an important issue, and is an important research topic. In this manuscript, we have synthesized the literature reviews and meta-analyses relating to modifiable risk factors associated with AD. Smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, physical inactivity, depression, head trauma, heart failure, bleeding and ischemic strokes, sleep apnea syndrome appeared to be associated with an increased risk of AD. In addition to these well-known associations, we highlight here the existence of associated factors less described: Hyperhomocysteinemia, hearing loss, essential tremor, occupational exposure to magnetic fields. On the contrary, some oral antidiabetic drugs, education and intellectual activity, a Mediterranean-type diet or using Healthy Diet Indicator, consumption of unsaturated fatty acids seemed to have a protective effect. Better knowledge of risk factors for AD allows for better identification of patients at risk. This may contribute to the emergence of prevention policies to delay or prevent the onset of AD.",2019,,Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,6,2,121-134,,10.14283/jpad.2019.7,,#531,Rochoy 2019
Embase,A comprehensive review of swallowing difficulties and dysphagia associated with antipsychotics in adults,"Cicala, G.; Barbieri, M.A.; Spina, E.; de Leon, J.","Introduction: This is a comprehensive review of antipsychotic (AP)-induced dysphagia and its complications: choking and pneumonia. Areas covered: Four PubMed searches were completed in 2018. The limited literature includes: 1) 45 case reports of AP-induced dysphagia with pharmacological mechanisms, 2) a systematic review of APs as a risk factor for dysphagia, 3) reviews suggesting adult patients with intellectual disability (ID) and dementia are prone to dysphagia (APs are a risk factor among multiple others), 4) studies of the increased risk of choking in patients with mental illness (APs are a contributing factor), 5) naturalistic pneumonia studies suggesting that pneumonia may contribute to AP-increased death in dementia, and 6) naturalistic studies suggesting that pneumonia may be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in clozapine patients. Expert commentary: The 2005 Food and Drug Administration requirement that package inserts warn of AP-induced dysphagia jumpstarted this area, but current studies are limited by: 1) its naturalistic nature, 2) the lack of dysphagia studies of patients with IDs and dementia on APs, and 3) the assumed indirect association between dysphagia with choking and pneumonia.

Embase,MicroRNAs and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review,"Piscopo, P.; Lacorte, E.; Feligioni, M.; Mayer, F.; Crestini, A.; Piccolo, L.; Bacigalupo, I.; Filareti, M.; Ficulle, E.; Confaloni, A.; Vanacore, N.; Corbo, M.","Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is usually described as an intermediate phase between normal cognition and dementia. Identifying the subjects at a higher risk of progressing from MCI to AD is essential to manage this condition. The diagnosis of MCI is mainly clinical. Several biomarkers have been proposed, but mostly for research purposes, as they are based on an invasive procedure to obtain the sample, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As a consequence, rapid and non-invasive biomarkers are needed to improve diagnosis. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize available evidence on the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in subjects with MCI. Methods: Relevant literature published up to June 2018 was retrieved searching the databases PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane Database. Only studies considering microRNAs (miRNAs) and a diagnosis of MCI were included. Data were extracted using a specifically-designed standardized form, and their methodological quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 and QUIPS. Results: Twenty-one studies of 153 retrieved articles met the predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies included participants ranging from 6 to 330. More than 40 miRNAs resulted as dysregulated, and miR-206 was the only miRNA that was found as differentially expressed in patients with MCI by more than two studies. However, these results have either not yet been confirmed in other independent cohorts, or data are still inconsistent. Inconsistencies among included studies could be due to several issues including the selection of participants, pre-analytical and analytical procedures, and statistical analyses.",2019,,Ageing Research Reviews,50,"(Piscopo P., paola.piscopo@iss.it; Crestini A.; Confaloni A.)

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing survival in clinically diagnosed DLB to AD. Longitudinal cohort studies were identified through a systematic search of major electronic databases from inception to May 2018. A random effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate survival time and relative risk of death. Results: Overall, 11 studies were identified including 22,952 patients with dementia: 2029 with DLB (mean diagnosis age 76.3; 47% female) compared with 20,923 with AD (mean diagnosis age 77.2; 65.1% female). Average survival time in DLB from diagnosis was 4.11 years (SD Â± 4.10) and in AD 5.66 (SD Â± 5.32) years, equating to a 1.60 (95% CI: -2.44 to -0.77) years shorter survival in DLB (p < 0.01).

The objective of this systematic review is to assess the evidence on the link between AD and exposure to a variety of toxic environmental risk factors beyond the work environment. Structured database search was used to identify relevant studies. Twenty-nine eligible studies examining the effect of various toxic environmental agents including electromagnetic fields, solvents, pesticides, toxic metals, and air pollutants were identified. Six out of 11 cohort studies and only two out of 18 case-control studies were considered high quality. Eight out of 12 studies found electromagnetic fields exposure to be a significant risk factor for AD. Significant evidence was also found for pesticide, aluminum, and solvent exposures.

Embase,Effectiveness of interventions to increase participation in advance care planning for people with a diagnosis of dementia: A systematic review,"Bryant, J.; Turon, H.; Waller, A.; Freund, M.; Mansfield, E.; Sanson-Fisher, R.","Background: Advance care planning involves considering, discussing and documenting future wishes in case a person is unable to make or communicate decisions. Given people with dementia are at high risk of future decisional incapacity, it is critical that advance care planning occurs early in the illness trajectory. Aim: To determine (1) the number of intervention studies published between 1997 and July 2017 that aimed to increase advance care planning for persons with dementia, (2) the methodological quality of studies and (3) the effectiveness of interventions in increasing advance care planning for persons with dementia. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched for articles published from 1997 to July 2017. Studies were included if they utilised a methodologically robust study design and reported on an intervention designed to increase participation in advance care planning for persons with dementia that was targeted at the person with dementia and/or a carer/family member. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors. Results: Four studies met the criteria for inclusion. Methodological quality was variable. Two studies did not report analyses comparing advance care planning outcomes for intervention and control participants. A third study found no effect for a nurse-facilitator intervention. The fourth study found that a structured conversation about end-of-life care with a family member increased the likelihood of advance care orders being listed in residentsâ€™ records. Conclusion: There is little evidence about effective strategies to improve participation in advance care planning for persons with dementia.

The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of factors associated with length of stay until death and the strength of evidence supporting each of these factors. Methodology: This is a systematic review; databases included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Proquest, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched. Observational studies, either prospective or retrospective, that explored multiple factors associated with length of stay until death in care homes were included. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were sourced, data extracted and assessed for quality. Data synthesis combined the direction and significance of association with the quality of the study, resulting in strong, moderate, weak or inconclusive evidence for each factor identified. Results: Forty-seven studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. After quality assessment, 14 studies were judged to be of a high quality, 31 of a moderate quality and 2 of a low quality. Three factors had strong evidence to support their association with shorter lengths of stay: Shortness of breath, receipt of oxygen therapy and admission to a facility providing nursing care. Conclusions: This review summarized the factors associated with length of stay. It found stronger evidence for physical functioning being associated with shorter lengths of stay than for cognitive functioning. An understanding of expected length of stay for older adults admitted to a care home is important for estimating lifetime costs and the implications of reforming funding arrangements for social care.

Embase,Exploring cocoa properties: is theobromine a cognitive modulator?,"Cova, I.; Leta, V.; Mariani, C.; Pantoni, L.; Pomati, S.","Nutritional qualities of cocoa have been acknowledged by several authors; a particular focus has been placed on its high content of flavanols, known for their excellent antioxidant properties and subsequent protective effect on cardio- and cerebrovascular systems as well as for neuromodulatory and neuroprotective actions. Other active components of cocoa are methylxanthines (caffeine and theobromine). Whereas the effects of caffeine are extensively researched, the same is not the case for theobromine; this review summarizes evidence on the effect of theobromine on cognitive functions. Considering animal studies, it can be asserted that acute exposition to theobromine has a reduced and delayed nootropic effect with respect to caffeine, whereas both animal and human studies suggested a potential neuroprotective action of long-term assumption of theobromine through a reduction of AÎ_ amyloid pathology, which is commonly observed in Alzheimerâ€™s disease patientsâ€™ brains. Hence, the conceivable action of theobromine alone and associated with caffeine or other cocoa constituents on cognitive modulation is yet underexplored and future studies are needed to shed light on this promising molecule.",2019,,Psychopharmacology,236,2,561-572,,10.1007/s00213-019-5172-0,,#521,Cova 2019
Embase,Comorbidity of diabetes mellitus in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: A systematic literature review,"Hudson, M.; Nowak, C.; Garling, R.J.; Harris, C.","Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a subtype of hydrocephalus that occurs more often in the elderly population. It is usually characterized by gait disturbance, dementia and urinary incontinence. Epidemiological studies indicate that 15.7-17.8% of iNPH patients present with type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM). A review of the primary literature shows that these occurrence rates are higher than age- and cohort-matched non-iNPH controls. This suggests that this already vulnerable patient group has an increased risk for presenting with DM compared to their non-iNPH counterparts. Postoperative outcome when treating iNPH patients is inversely related to the number of patient comorbidities and a lower comorbidity status is correlated with better outcomes. This review highlights the need for further research into the relationship between iNPH and DM and speculates on a possible mechanism for an association between the development of ventriculomegaly and the development of DM and iNPH.",2019,,Fluids and Barriers of the CNS,16,1,,,10.1186/s12987-019-0125-x,,#520,Hudson 2019
Embase,A Literature Review of Psychotropic Medications and Alcohol as Risk Factors for Falls in Community Dwelling Older Adults,"Laberge, S.; Crizzle, A.M.","Psychotropic medications and alcohol are potential risk factors for falls in older adults. However, there has been no appraisal of the literature on whether these medications, both singly and in combination with alcohol, are associated with falls in community dwelling older adults (those aged 60Â years and older living independently without care). Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS) and the grey literature (i.e. WHO, Public Health Agency of Canada) were searched using the following terms: benzodiazepine, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, anti-epileptic, lithium, memantine, anti-hypertensives: drug or medication, aged or elderly or older adult or senior, accidental falls or falls or falling, and alcohol. Studies were included if (1) they were primary studies; (2) included community dwelling persons aged 60Â years and older; (3) alcohol use was an independent variable; (4) studiedÂ medications of interest; (5) falls was theÂ outcome variable; and (6) published in English. Articles published until July 2018 were included. The search yielded 29 studies. The findings show that both benzodiazepines and antidepressants (particularly SSRIs) are associated with fall risk while antipsychotics, anti-hypertensives, anti-epileptics and alcohol are not.

Methods: In the current study, we updated our recently published meta-analyses on occupational exposures in relation to ALS, Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Based on 66 original publications of good scientific epidemiological standard, according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) guidelines, we analysed subgroups by carrying out stratified meta-analyses on publication year, statistical precision of the relative risk (RR) estimates, inspection of the funnel plots and test of bias. Results: Based on 19 studies the weighted RR for occupational exposure to EMFs was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07â€“1.50) for ALS, 1.33 (95% CI 1.07â€“1.64) for Alzheimerâ€™s disease and 1.02 (95% CI 0.83â€“1.26) for Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Thirty-one studies concerned occupational exposure to pesticides and the weighted RR was 1.35 (95% CI 1.02â€“1.79) for ALS, 1.50 (95% CI 0.98â€“2.29) for Alzheimerâ€™s disease and 1.66 (95% CI 1.42â€“1.94) for Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Finally, 14 studies concerned occupational exposure to metals and only exposure to lead (five studies) involved an elevated risk for ALS or Parkinsonâ€™s disease and the weighted RR was 1.57 (95% CI 1.11â€“2.20). The weighted RR for all the non-lead exposures was 0.97 (95% CI 0.88â€“1.06). Conclusions: Exposure to pesticides increased the risk of getting the mentioned neurodegenerative diseases by at least 50%.

Whether anticoagulation is associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline in participants with AF still remains controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of anticoagulation on the risk of cognitive decline in patients with AF.Methods:We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Database for eligible studies published up to January 2018. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for cognitive decline were extracted, and pooled estimations were calculated using the fixed effects model. Subgroup analyses were further performed.Results:Eight relevant articles involved 454,273 patients were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. We found that anticoagulation was associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment as compared with nonanticoagulation (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.69-0.75, I2 11.5%). This reduction was still significant after adjustment for stroke and TIA (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.69-0.74, I2 0.0%). In the subgroup analyses, the incidence of cognitive decline was significantly decreased in those treated with anticoagulation compared to no treatment (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.69-0.75, I2 0.0%), but the cognitive benefit showed no significant difference between anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68-1.50, I2 46.8%).Conclusion:Anticoagulation is associated with cognitive benefit in participants with AF independent of stroke and TIA, but it was not superior to antiplatelet drugs in reducing the risk of cognitive decline.",2019,,Medicine (United States),98,7,,,10.1097/MD.0000000000014499,,#515,Zeng 2019
Embase,Prevalence and risk of progression of preclinical Alzheimer's disease stages: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Parnetti, L.; Chipi, E.; Salvadori, N.; D'Andrea, K.; Eusebi, P.","Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins several years before the clinical onset. The long preclinical phase is composed of three stages according to the 2011National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria, followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a featured clinical entity defined as ""due to AD"", or ""prodromal AD"", when pathophysiological biomarkers (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid or positron emission tomography with amyloid tracer) are positive. In the clinical setting, there is a clear need to detect the earliest symptoms not yet fulfilling MCI criteria, in order to proceed to biomarker assessment for diagnostic definition, thus offering treatment with disease-modifying drugs to patients as early as possible. According to the available evidence, we thus estimated the prevalence and risk of progression at each preclinical AD stage, with special interest in Stage 3. Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies published from April 2008 to May 2018 were obtained through MEDLINE-PubMed, screened, and systematically reviewed by four independent reviewers. Data from included studies were meta-analyzed using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed by I 2 statistics. Results: Estimated overall prevalence of preclinical AD was 22% (95% CI = 18-26%). Rate of biomarker positivity overlapped in cognitively normal individuals and people with subjective cognitive decline. The risk of progression increases across preclinical AD stages, with individuals classified as NIA-AA Stage 3 showing the highest risk (73%, 95% CI = 40-92%) compared to those in Stage 2 (38%, 95% CI = 21-59%) and Stage 1 (20%, 95% CI = 10-34%). Conclusion: Available data consistently show that risk of progression increases across the preclinical AD stages, where Stage 3 shows a risk of progression comparable to MCI due to AD. Accordingly, an effort should be made to also operationalize the diagnostic work-up in subjects with subtle cognitive deficits not yet fulfilling MCI criteria. The possibility to define, in the clinical routine, a patient as ""pre-MCI due to AD"" could offer these subjects the opportunity to use disease-modifying drugs at best.",2019,,Alzheimer's Research and Therapy,11,1,,,10.1186/s13195-018-0459-7,,#513,Parnetti 2019

However, long-term studies on humans provided controversial results, making the prediction of polyphenol impact on health uncertain. The aim of this review is to provide an overview and critical analysis of the literature related to the effects of the principal dietary polyphenols on cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. We critically considered and meta-analyzed randomized controlled clinical trials involving subjects taking polyphenol-based supplements. Although some polyphenols might improve specific markers of cardiovascular risk and cognitive status, many inconsistent data are present in literature. Therefore, definitive recommendations for the use of these compounds in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline are currently not applicable.

Embase,Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators: Current Knowledge and Clinical Applications,"Solomon, Z.J.; Mirabal, J.R.; Mazur, D.J.; Kohn, T.P.; Lipshultz, L.I.; Pastuszak, A.W.","Introduction: Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) differentially bind to androgen receptors depending on each SARM's chemical structure. As a result, SARMs result in anabolic cellular activity while avoiding many of the side effects of currently available anabolic steroids. SARMs have been studied in the treatment of breast cancer and cachexia and have also been used as performance-enhancing agents. Here, we evaluate and summarize the current literature on SARMs. Aim: To present the background, mechanisms, current and potential clinical applications, as well as risks and benefits of SARMs. Methods: A literature review was performed in MEDLINE using the terms selective androgen receptor modulator, hypogonadism, cachexia, breast cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, libido, and lean muscle mass. Both basic research and clinical studies were included. Main Outcome Measure: To complete a review of peer-reviewed literature. Results: Although there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Agency-approved indications for SARMs, investigators are exploring the potential uses for these compounds. Basic research has focused on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these agents, demonstrating good availability with a paucity of drug interactions. Early clinical studies have demonstrated potential uses for SARMs in the treatment of cancer-related cachexia, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypogonadism, and breast cancer, with positive results. Conclusion: SARMs have numerous possible clinical applications, with promise for the safe use in the treatment of cachexia, BPH, hypogonadism, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.

Embase,Decreased serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD): A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Ng, T.K.S.; Ho, C.S.H.; Tam, W.W.S.; Kua, E.H.; Ho, R.C.-M.","Findings from previous studies reporting the levels of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been conflicting. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the aggregate levels of serum BDNF in patients with AD and individuals with MCI, in comparison with healthy controls. Fifteen studies were included for the comparison between AD and healthy control (HC) (n = 2067). Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in patients with AD (SMD: âˆ’0.282; 95% confidence interval [CI]: âˆ’0.535 to âˆ’0.028; significant heterogeneity: I2 = 83.962). Meta-regression identified age (p < 0.001) and MMSE scores (p < 0.001) to be the significant moderators that could explain the heterogeneity in findings in these studies. Additionally, there were no significant differences in serum BDNF levels between patients with AD and MCI (eight studies, n = 906) and between MCI and HC (nine studies, n = 5090). In all, patients with AD, but not MCI, have significantly lower serum BDNF levels compared to healthy controls. This meta-analysis confirmed the direction of change in serum BDNF levels in dementia. This finding suggests that a significant change in peripheral BDNF levels can only be detected at the late stage of the dementia spectrum. Molecular mechanisms, implications on interventional trials, and future directions for studies examining BDNF in dementia were discussed.",2019,,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,20,2,,,10.3390/ijms20020257,,#505,Ng 2019
Embase,Handling of informed consent and patient inclusion in research with geriatric trauma patients â€“ A matter of protection or disrespect?,"Jensen, J.S.; Reiter-Theil, S.; Celio, D.A.; Jakob, M.; Vach, W.; Saxer, F.J.","Background: Despite the aging of numerous societies and future health care challenges, clinical research in the elderly is underrepresented. The aim of this review was to analyze the current practice exemplary in gerontotraumatology and to discuss potential improvements. Materials and methods: A literature review was performed in 2016 based on a PubMed search for gerontotraumatologic studies published between 2005 and 2015. Trials were evaluated for methodology and ethical and age-related aspects. Results: The search revealed 649 articles, 183 of which met the inclusion criteria. The age range for inclusion was heterogeneous; one-third of trials included patients <65 years and only 11% excluded very elderly. Seventy-four trials excluded patients with typical comorbidities, with 55% of these without stating scientific reasons. Frailty was assessed in 94 trials and defined as the exclusion criterion in 66 of them. Informed consent (IC) was reportedly obtained in 144 trials; descriptions of the IC process mostly remained vague. Substitute decision making was described in 19 trials; the consenting party remained unclear in 45 articles. Diagnosed dementia was a primary exclusion criterion in 31% of the trials. Seventeen trials assessed decisional capacity before inclusion, with six using specific assessments. Conclusion: Many trials in gerontotraumatology exclude relevant subgroups of patients, and thus risk presenting biased estimates of the relevant treatment effects. Exclusion based on age, cognitive impairment, or other exhaustive exclusion criteria impedes specific scientific progress in the treatment of elderly patients. Meaningful trials could profit from a staged, transparent approach that fosters shared decision making.

They also have systemic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties suggesting potential utility for improving clinical outcomes for a wide range of diseases. The literature provides data suggesting benefit in patients with comorbidities associated with contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, head injury, neurological disease (e.g. Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s disease), prostate cancer, nuclear cataract and spinal cord injury. This systematic review evaluates the current evidence supporting the potential benefit of statins outside their customary role of attenuating cardiovascular risk reduction. Methods: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies published January 2000-March 2018 reporting comorbidity reduction associated with statin use. Results: Fifty-eight publications that satisfied our selection criteria (based on the PRISM guidance for systematic reviews) were selected and included case-control, cohort, cross-sectional and observational studies as well as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Ten studies addressed statin use and incidence of CIN after coronary imaging; 8 addressed statin use in patients with COPD; 14 addressed statin use and comorbidity reduction associated with head injury and/or a neurological disease disorder; 5 addressed the association between statin use and nuclear cataract; 9 addressed the association between statin use and prostate/colorectal cancer; 9 studies addressed the role of statin use in treating infections; and 3 addressed the association between statin use and spinal cord injury related survival rate. Conclusion: Overall, the literature supports beneficial pleiotropic effects of statin use in contrast-induced nephropathy, head injury, Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, nuclear cataract, prostate cancer, infection management, and spinal cord injury.

Here, we aim to identify the potential viral pathogens leading to aberrant inflammatory and oxidative stress response in AD along with potential drug candidates using systems biology approach. We retrieved protein interactions of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein (MAPT) from NCBI and genes for oxidative stress from NetAge, for inflammation from NetAge and InnateDB databases. Genes implicated in aging were retrieved from GenAge database and two GEO expression datasets. These genes were individually used to create protein-protein interaction network using STRING database (scoreâ‰¥0.7). The interactions of candidate genes with known viruses were mapped using virhostnet v2.0 database. Drug molecules targeting candidate genes were retrieved using the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). Data mining resulted in 2095 APP, 116 MAPT, 214 oxidative stress, 1269 inflammatory genes. After STRING PPIN analysis, 404 APP, 109 MAPT, 204 oxidative stress and 1014 inflammation related high confidence proteins were identified. The overlap among all datasets yielded eight common markers (AKT1, GSK3B, APP, APOE, EGFR, PIN1, CASP8 and SNCA). These genes showed association with hepatitis C virus (HCV), EpsteinBarr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 8 and Human papillomavirus (HPV). Further, screening of drugs targeting candidate genes, and possessing anti-inflammatory property, antiviral activity along with a suggested role in AD pathophysiology yielded 12 potential drug candidates.

Embase,Essential tremor and parkinsonâ€™s disease: Exploring the relationship,"Tarakad, A.; Jankovic, J.","Background: There is longstanding controversy surrounding the possible link between essential tremor(ET)and Parkinsonâ€™s disease(PD). Inconsistent and unreliable diagnostic criteria may in part account for some of the difficulties in defining the relationship between these two common movement disorders. Methods: References for this systematic review were identified using PubMed with the search terms â€˜â€˜essential tremorâ€™â€™ AND â€˜â€˜Parkinsonâ€™s diseaseâ€™â€™ with articles published in English between 1960 and September 2018 included. Results: In this review we provide evidence that some patients diagnosed with ET have an increased risk of developing PD years or decades after onset of action tremor. There are several still unresolved questions about the link between the two disorders including lack of verifiable diagnostic criteria for the two disorders and marked overlap in phenomenology. Here we review clinical, epidemiologic, imaging, pathologic, and genetic studies that address the ETâ€“PD relationship. Several lines of evidence support the association between ET and PD, including overlapping motor and non-motor features, relatively high prevalence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder(26â€“43%)in ET patients, increased prevalence of PD in patients with longstanding antecedent ET, increased prevalence of ET in family members of patients with PD, and the presence of Lewy bodies in the brains of some ET patients(15â€“24%).

Embase,Uric acid and plant-based nutrition,"JakÅ¡e, B.; Pajek, M.; Pajek, J.","Plant-based diets (PBDs) are associated with decreased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with important noncommunicable chronic diseases. Similar to animal-based food sources (e.g., meat, fish, and animal visceral organs), some plant-based food sources (e.g., certain soy legume products, sea vegetables, and brassica vegetables) also contain a high purine load. Suboptimally designed PBDs might consequently be associated with increased uric acid levels and gout development. Here, we review the available data on this topic, with a great majority of studies showing reduced risk of hyperuricemia and gout with vegetarian (especially lacto-vegetarian) PBDs. Additionally, type of ingested purines, fiber, vitamin C, and certain lifestyle factors work in concordance to reduce uric acid generation in PBDs. Recent limited data show that even with an exclusive PBD, uric acid concentrations remain in the normal range in short-and long-term dieters. The reasonable consumption of plant foods with a higher purine content as a part of PBDs may therefore be safely tolerated in normouricemic individuals, but additional data is needed in hyperuricemic individuals, especially those with chronic kidney disease.",2019,,Nutrients,11,8,,,10.3390/nu11081736,,#498,JakÅ¡e 2019

One factor frequently mentioned in the etiology of NDDs is the generation of free radicals and oxidative stress, producing cellular damages. Studies have shown that the consumption of foods rich in polyphenols, especially those of the flavonoid class, has been related to the low risk in the development of several diseases. Due to the antioxidant properties present in the food, a fruit that has been gaining prominence among these foods is the Euterpe oleracea Mart.

Embase,Preventing dementia: Shifting focus towards potential modifiable risk factors,"Menge, D.M.; Nair, N.; Kumar, P.R.A.V.","Around the world, 50 million people live with dementia, an incurable disease. The number is expected to surpass 150 million in three decades. The burden on the economy keeps escalating every year. However, encouraging evidence from studies in Europe reveal a decline in rates of incidence dementia. Although the prevalence still remains high, new cases have become fewer. Therefore, research has shifted focus to the role of potential modifiable factors in curbing incidence dementia. Better management of vascular risk factors over the last couple of decades has seen the risk of dementia decrease dramatically. Studies on adherence to Mediterranean diet, moderate alcohol consumption and incorporation of physical activity into daily activities suggest the risk of dementia might be modified in vulnerable population. Smokers should be encouraged and supported to give up the habit. Identification of these potential modifiable risk factors doesn't mean that dementia can eventually be stopped, but this is a start toward decreasing the risk and improving lives of people with dementia. For this review paper, we searched for original articles and review papers in EMBASE and PubMed. Keywords were used individually or in combination in the searches. The keywords used include: dementia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, hypercholesterolemia, cognitive reserve, physical activity, physical exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, Mediterranean diet and hyperhomocysteinemia.

Consistent epidemiological evidence suggests an increased risk of dementia associated to type 2 diabetes; the mechanisms underlying these associations, however, remain unclear. Objective: The study aims to review epidemiological, clinical and pre-clinical data that weigh on pathophysiological links, mechanisms of disease and associations between type 2 diabetes and dementia to identify areas of opportunity for future research. Methods: We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases: PUBMED, EMBASE, SCIELO, MEDLINE and OVID for clinical, translational and epidemiological research literature that summarize diabetes-related risk factors for dementia, metabolic and neurological changes associated to T2D, evidence of therapeutic approaches in type 2 diabetes and its pathophysiological implications for dementia. Results: Type 2 diabetes mellitus increases risk for all-cause dementia, vascular dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The most evaluated mechanisms linking both disorders in pre-clinical studies include an increase in neuronal insulin resistance, impaired insulin signaling, pro-inflammatory state, mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular damage which increase deposition of Î_-amyloid, tau proteins and GSK3Î_, leading to an earlier onset of dementia in individuals with impairment in the glucose metabolism. Neuroimaging and neuropathology evidence linking cerebrovascular lesions, neurodegeneration and particularly small-vessel disease in the onset of dementia is consistent with the increased risk of incident dementia in type 2 diabetes, but consistent evidence of AD-related pathology is scarce. Epidemiological data shows increased risk of dementia related to hypoglycemic episodes, glycemic control, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and genetic predisposition, but the evidence is not consistent and statistical analysis might be affected by inconsistent covariate controlling. Therapeutic approaches for T2D have shown inconsistent result in relation to dementia prevention and delay of cognitive decline; lifestyle intervention, particularly physical activity, is a promising alternative to ameliorate the impact of disability and frailty on T2D-related dementia. Conclusion: Vascular disease, inflammation and impaired brain insulin signaling might occur in T2D and contribute to dementia risk. Evidence from epidemiological studies has not consistently reported associations that could integrate a unified mechanism of disease in humans. Evaluation of the effect of antidiabetic medications and non-pharmacological interventions in dementia prevention in type 2 diabetes is promising but has thus far offered inconsistent results.",2019,,Current Diabetes Reviews,15,6,456-470,,10.2174/1573399815666190129155654,,#491,Bello-Chavolla 2019
Embase,Imaging of brain glucose uptake by PET in obesity and cognitive dysfunction: Life-course perspective,"Iozzo, P.; Guzzardi, M.A.","The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and keeps growing. Obesity seems implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and dementia, and vice versa. Growing scientific efforts are being devoted to the identification of central mechanisms underlying the frequent association between obesity and cognitive dysfunction. Glucose brain handling undergoes dynamic changes during the life-course, suggesting that its alterations might precede and contribute to degenerative changes or signaling abnormalities. Imaging of the glucose analog18 F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18 FDG) by positron emission tomography (PET) is the gold-standard for the assessment of cerebral glucose metabolism in vivo. This review summarizes the current literature addressing brain glucose uptake measured by PET imaging, and the effect of insulin on brain metabolism, trying to embrace a life-course vision in the identification of patterns that may explain (and contribute to) the frequent association between obesity and cognitive dysfunction. The current evidence supports that brain hypermetabolism and brain insulin resistance occur in selected high-risk conditions as a transient phenomenon, eventually evolving toward normal or low values during life or disease progression. Associative studies suggest that brain hypermetabolism predicts low BDNF levels, hepatic and whole body insulin resistance, food desire and an unfavorable balance between anticipated reward from food and cognitive inhibitory control. Emerging mechanistic links involve the microbiota and the metabolome, which correlate with brain metabolism and cognition, deserving attention as potential future prevention targets.",2019,,Endocrine Connections,8,11,R169-R183,,10.1530/EC-19-0348,,#490,Iozzo 2019

However, methodological limitations of the analytical tools used may hamper their ability to generate reliable dementia risk scores. We aim to review the used methodologies. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature from March 2014 to September 2018 for publications presenting a dementia risk prediction model. We critically discuss the analytical techniques used in the literature. Results: In total 137 publications were included in the qualitative synthesis. Three techniques were identified as the most commonly used methodologies: machine learning, logistic regression, and Cox regression. Discussion: We identified three major methodological weaknesses: (1) over-reliance on one data source, (2) poor verification of statistical assumptions of Cox and logistic regression, and (3) lack of validation. The use of larger and more diverse data sets is recommended. Assumptions should be tested thoroughly, and actions should be taken if deviations are detected.",2019,,Alzheimer's and Dementia: Translational Research and Clinical Interventions,5,"(Goerdten J., jantje.goerdten@ed.ac.uk; ÄŒukiÄ‡ I.; Danso S.O.; Muniz-Terrera G.)

Embase,Neural correlates of altered insight in frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review,"MuÃ±oz-Neira, C.; Tedde, A.; Coulthard, E.; Thai, N.J.; Pennington, C.","Altered insight into disease or specific symptoms is a prominent clinical feature of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Understanding the neural bases of insight is crucial to help improve FTD diagnosis, classification and management. A systematic review to explore the neural correlates of altered insight in FTD and associated syndromes was conducted. Insight was fractionated to examine whether altered insight into different neuropsychological/behavioural objects is underpinned by different or compatible neural correlates. 6 databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, BIOSIS and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global) were interrogated between 1980 and August 2019. 15 relevant papers were found out of 660 titles screened. The studies included suggest that different objects of altered insight are associated with distinctive brain areas in FTD. For example, disease unawareness appears to predominantly correlate with right frontal involvement. In contrast, altered insight into social cognition potentially involves, in addition to frontal areas, the temporal gyrus, insula, parahippocampus and amygdala. Impaired insight into memory problems appears to be related to the frontal lobes, postcentral gyrus, parietal cortex and posterior cingulate. These results reflect to a certain extent those observed in other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also other brain disorders. Nevertheless, they should be cautiously interpreted due to variability in the methodological aspects used to reach those conclusions. Future work should triangulate different insight assessment approaches and brain imaging techniques to increase the understanding of this highly relevant clinical phenomenon in dementia.",2019,,NeuroImage: Clinical,24,"(MuÃ±oz-Neira C., carlos.munoz@bristol.ac.uk; Coulthard E.; Pennington C.)

Embase,Length of hospital stay and dementia: A systematic review of observational studies,"MÃ¶llers, T.; Stocker, H.; Wei, W.; Perna, L.; Brenner, H.","Objective: Hospitalizations of people with dementia (PWD) are often accompanied by complications or functional loss and can lead to adverse outcomes. Unsystematic findings suggest an influence of comorbidities on the extent of differences in the length of hospital stay (LOS). This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate all studies reporting LOS in PWD as compared to PwoD in general hospitals. Methods: A systematic review of observational studies using PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge. Inclusion criteria comprised original studies written in English or German, assessment of diagnosis of dementia, measurement of LOS, and comparison of people with and without dementia. Results: Fifty-two of 60 studies reported a longer hospitalization time for PWD compared to PwoD. The extent of the difference in LOS varied between and within countries as well as by type of primary morbidity (eg, injuries, cardiovascular diseases). The range of the LOS difference for studies without restriction to a primary morbidity was âˆ’2 to +22Â days after matching or adjustment for a variable number and selection of potentially relevant covariates. For studies with injuries/fractures/medical procedures and infectious/vascular disease as the primary morbidity, the range was âˆ’2.9 to +12.4 and âˆ’11.2 to +21.8Â days, respectively. Conclusions: The majority of studies reported a longer hospitalization of PWD compared to PwoD. Length of hospital stay seems to be influenced by a variety of medical, social, organizational factors, including reasons for hospital admission, whose role should be explored in detail in further research.",2019,,International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,34,1,21-Aug,,10.1002/gps.4993,,#482,MÃ¶llers 2019
Embase,Essential Oils as Treatment Strategy for Alzheimer's Disease: Current and Future Perspectives,"Benny, A.; Thomas, J.","Alzheimer's disease is a multifarious neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive impairment and gradual memory loss. Several hypotheses have been put forward to postulate its pathophysiology. Currently, few drugs are available for the management of Alzheimer's disease and the treatment provides only symptomatic relief. Our aim is to review the relevant in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies focused toward the potential uses of essential oils in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar from April 1998 to June 2018 were explored to collect data. We have conducted wide search on various essential oils used in different models of Alzheimer's disease. Out of 55 essential oils identified for Alzheimer's intervention, 28 have been included in the present review. A short description of in vivo studies of 13 essential oils together with clinical trial data of Salvia officinalis, Salvia lavandulifolia, Melissa officinalis, Lavandula angustifolia, and Rosmarinus officinalis have been highlighted. In vitro studies of remaining essential oils that possess antioxidant and anticholinesterase potential are also mentioned.

It is known that vascular risk factors play an important role in the development and progression of this condition. Alterations in vascular walls represent documented findings in patients with AD and other dementias affecting elderly people. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, aiming to synthesize observational studies that evaluated how the hemostatic system may contribute to cognitive decline in the elderly, using papers published until April 2018 and as indexed in Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Lilacs, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Among 5,278 studies identified, 32 were included in the final synthesis, and these included 485 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 568 with vascular dementia (VD), 1,781 with AD, and 2,855 participants without dementia.

Embase,Mitochondria- And oxidative stress-targeting substances in cognitive decline-related disorders- And molecular mechanisms to clinical evidence,"Lejri, I.; Agapouda, A.; Grimm, A.; Eckert, A.","Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting people mainly in their sixth decade of life and at a higher age. It is an extensively studied neurodegenerative disorder yet incurable to date. While its main postmortem brain hallmarks are the presence of amyloid-Î_ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles, the onset of the disease seems to be largely correlated to mitochondrial dysfunction, an early event in the disease pathogenesis. AD is characterized by flawed energy metabolism in the brain and excessive oxidative stress, processes that involve less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and more reactive oxygen species (ROS) production respectively. Mitochondria are at the center of both these processes as they are responsible for energy and ROS generation through mainly oxidative phosphorylation. Standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE), resveratrol, and phytoestrogens as well as the neurosteroid allopregnanolone have shown not only some mitochondria-modulating properties but also significant antioxidant potential in in vitro and in vivo studies. According to our review of the literature, GBE, resveratrol, allopregnanolone, and phytoestrogens showed promising effects on mitochondria in a descending evidence order and, notably, this order pattern is in line with the existing clinical evidence level for each entity. In this review, the effects of these four entities are discussed with special focus on their mitochondria-modulating effects and their mitochondria-improving and antioxidant properties across the spectrum of cognitive decline-related disorders.

Objective: To assess the impacts of overweight and obesity in older age on incident dementia. Methods: We searched cohort studies reporting body weight measured in older age and dementia through PubMed, Embase, Medline, PyschInfo, and Cochrane library until July 2016. Sixteen articles were identified for the review. We pooled data from them and a new unpublished study from China, to calculate relative risk (RR) of incident dementia in relation to body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Results: All 16 cohort studies were undertaken in high income countries, with follow-up periods ranging between 3 to 18 years. Thirteen studies showed an inverse association between BMI and dementia, and three studies demonstrated a positive association. Pooled RR of dementia in relation to continuous BMI from 14 studied populations, including the new Chinese data, was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-1.00); in those followed up <9 years it was 0.95 (0.93-0.96) while in â‰¥9 years follow-up it was 1.03 (0.96-1.11). In five studied populations examining categorical BMI, RR of dementia in older people classified as overweight and obese was 0.98 (0.54-1.77) and 1.17 (0.65-2.10) respectively, in comparison with other weights. The pooled WC data showed no association between increased WC and reduced risk of dementia. Conclusion: The current evidence did not support a paradox on beneficial impacts of overweight and obesity in older age on incident dementia. More studies with long term follow up are needed to clarify the association of body weight in older age with dementia risk.",2019,,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,70,s1,S87-S99,,10.3233/JAD-180763,,#473,Danat 2019
Embase,Preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of extracts or compounds from cistanches for Alzheimer's disease,"Zhou, X.-L.; Xu, M.-B.; Jin, T.-Y.; Rong, P.-Q.; Zheng, G.-Q.; Lin, Y.","Currently, disease-modified strategies to prevent, halt or reverse the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still lacking. Previous studies indicated extracts or compounds from Cistanches (ECC) exert a potential neuroprotective effect against AD. Thus, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to assess preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of ECC in experimental AD. A systematical searching strategy was carried out across seven databases from their inceptions to July 2018. Twenty studies with 1696 rats or mice were involved. Neurobehavioral function indices as primary outcome measures were established by the Morris water maze test (n = 11), step-down test (n = 10), electrical Y-maze test (n = 4), step-through test (n = 3), open field test (n = 2) and passage water maze test (n = 1). Compared with controls, the results of the meta-analysis showed ECC exerted a significant effect in decreasing the escape latency, error times and wrong reaction latency in both the training test and the retention test, and in increasing the exact time and the percentage of time in the platform-quadrant and the number of platform crossings (all P<0.01). In conclusion, ECC exert potential neuroprotective effects in experimental AD, mainly through mechanisms involving antioxidant stress and antiapoptosic effects, inhibiting AÎ_ deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation and promoting synapse protection. Thus, ECC could be a candidate for AD treatment and further clinical trials.",2019,,Aging and Disease,10,5,1075-1093,,10.14336/AD.2018.0815-1,,#470,Zhou 2019
Embase,Statin-associated adverse events,"Yuet, W.C.; Khine, H.; Ahmad, Z.","Although statins are well tolerated, their widespread use has raised awareness of rare adverse events. For example, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued product label warnings about statin-associated myopathy, incident diabetes, and cognitive impairment. Addi-tional statin-associated adverse effects include proteinuria, transaminitis, and hemorrhagic stroke. The underlying pathophysiology of these adverse events remains unclear, and thus little guidance exists on addressing these issues at the bedside. Although statin-associated myopathy is common, many patients eventually tolerate a statin â€“ albeit at less than ideal doses. Incident diabetes remains difficult to predict, but high statin potency, increasing age, and pre-existing diabetes risk factors may predispose patients. Cognitive impairment â€“ described mostly in case reports â€“ may resolve after discontinuation of the offending statin. Rosuvastatin is linked to dose-dependent proteinuria. Elevated transaminases are reversible and unlikely to cause severe consequences. History of cerebrovascular disease increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke on statin therapy. Overall, a thorough understanding of statin-associated adverse events will help health care providers manage patients who develop these complications.

Embase,Unplanned Transfer to Emergency Departments for Frail Elderly Residents of Aged Care Facilities: A Review of Patient and Organizational Factors,"Dwyer, R.; Stoelwinder, J.; Gabbe, B.; Lowthian, J.","Background: With an aging population, a growing number of older adults experience physical or cognitive decline that necessitates admission to residential aged care facilities (RACF). Each year a considerable proportion of these residents has at least 1 emergency transfer to hospital, which may result in a number of adverse outcomes. Rates of transfer from RACF to hospital can vary considerably between different RACFs suggesting the presence of potentially modifiable risk factors for emergency department (ED) transfer. Methods: A systematic and comprehensive search of the peer-reviewed literature using 4 electronic databases was conducted. Included papers were those reporting on determinants of unplanned transfer to hospital for elderly people (aged 65 years and above) living in RACFs. Studies were assessed for quality and key concepts and themes extracted. Results: There are both individual patient factors and health system factors, which influence rates of transfer to hospital for elderly RACF residents. For individuals, increased risk of ED transfer has been associated with presence of particular comorbidities such as chronic airways disease, congestive cardiac failure, and diabetes; presence of indwelling devices; absence of an advance care plan; and reduced functional ability. For organizations, ""for profit"" facilities and those with poorer staff to patient ratios also have higher rates of transfer to hospital, compared with those owned by not-for-profit organizations and those with improved registered nurse and medical practitioner staffing. Conclusions: This review has identified a number of potentially modifiable patient and organizational factors that should reduce the need for burdensome transfer to the ED and improve the quality of both acute care and end-of-life care for this population of frail, elderly individuals. A number of these determinants, including facility staffing, the role of specialist geriatricians, and advance directives, should be further examined, ideally through interventional trials to evaluate their impact on the pre-hospital and emergency management of these patients.",2015,,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,16,7,551-562,,10.1016/j.jamda.2015.03.007,,#468,Dwyer 2015

Hence, an attempt is made in this work for systematic review and meta-analysis of W. somnifera on neurobehavioural disorders induced by brain oxidative stress in rodents. Methods A systematic search of the effect of W. somnifera on brain oxidative stress-induced neuronal pathology was performed using electronic databases. The systematic review was performed on neurobehavioural parameters, whereas meta-analysis of W. somnifera effect was done on oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione and lipid peroxidation), nitrite, protein carbonyl, AchE, ChAT and Ach of rodent brain. Data were analysed using Review Manager Software. Key findings Twenty-eight studies were selected based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria. W. somnifera appreciably inhibited the neurological abnormalities due to oxidative stress in rodent brain produced by different physical and chemical stimuli.

However, evidence is currently limited and has rarely been systematically reviewed, particularly in a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) population. This review examined the effect of diet on cognitive outcomes in MCI patients. A total of five databases were searched to find randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies, with diet as the main focus, in MCI participants. The primary outcome was incident dementia and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and secondary outcomes included cognitive function across different domains using validated neuropsychological tests. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a high degree of heterogeneity relating to the nature of the dietary intervention and cognitive outcomes measured, thus making study comparisons difficult. Supplementation with vitamin E (one study, n 516), ginkgo biloba (one study, n 482) or Fortasyn Connect (one study, n 311) had no significant effect on progression from MCI to dementia and/or AD.

Hormone therapy (HT) used to be the standard of care for managing vasomotor symptoms and prevention of chronic diseases until publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002. Concerned about risks highlighted in WHI publications, many symptomatic women promptly ceased HT which resulted in increased vasomotor symptoms, osteoporosis-related-fractures and insomnia. Data from post-hoc WHI analyses and newer clinical trials consistently show reductions in coronary heart disease and mortality when estrogen therapy is initiated soon after menopause, whereas administration in later years and/or in combination with progesterone carries increased risks. However, no validated primary preventive strategies are available for younger postmenopausal women (<60 years), highlighting the need to re-evaluate the use of estrogen alone for which the riskâ€“benefit balance appears positive. In contrast, in older women (>60 years), risks associated with oral HT exceed benefits; however transdermal estrogen may offer a safer alternative and should be further evaluated. Alternative therapies such as phytoestrogens and non-hormonal prescriptions may be beneficial for older women or those who are unsuitable for HT.

Such treatments involve the administration of allergen preparations in various forms and by various routes. Virus-like particles (VLPs) offer aÂ very effective platform for immunization with the allergen and are characterized by high immunogenicity, low allergenicity and high clinical efficacy. Formulations that include Toll-like receptor ligands, TÂ cell stimulatory epitopes and/or depot-forming adjuvants appear to enhance activation of the relevant immune cells. Short nucleotide sequences including CpG motifs have also been intensively explored as potent stimulators of dendritic cells and BÂ cells. Methods: The present paper is based on aÂ systematic literature search in PubMed and MEDLINE, and focuses on the pertinent immunological processes and on clinical data relating to use of VLPs and CpG motifs for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). Results: Many published studies have reported positive clinical results following administration of VLPs, either alone or in combination with CpG motifs and, in some cases, even in the absence of the allergen-specific allergen. Conclusions: These results indicate that VLPs modulate immune responses in ways which underline their exceptional promise as aÂ platform for the immunotherapy of allergic disorders.

Embase,Behavioral Impact of Return of Genetic Test Results for Complex Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Frieser, M.J.; Wilson, S.; Vrieze, S.","Objective: Advances in genomewide association studies have made possible the return of genetic risk results for complex diseases. Two concerns about these results are (a) negative psychological consequences and (b) viewing probabilistic results as deterministic, leading to misinterpretation and inappropriate decisions. The present study evaluates these concerns through a meta-analytic review of existing literature. Method: Seventeen genetic testing studies of complex disease, including 1,171 participants and reporting 195 effects, 104 of which were unadjusted for covariates, were meta-analyzed under a random effects model. Diseases included Alzheimer's, cardiovascular and coronary heart disease, lung cancer, melanoma, thrombophilia, and type II diabetes. Six domains of behavioral-psychological reactions were examined. Results: Carriers showed significantly increased self-reported behavior change compared to noncarriers when assessed 6 months or later after results return (Hedges's g = .36, p = .019). Conclusions: Return of genetic testing results for complex disease does not strongly impact self-reported negative behavior or psychological function of at-risk individuals. Return of results does appear to moderately increase self-reported healthy behavior in carriers, although research on objectively observed behavior change is needed. This is a growing area of research, with preliminary results suggesting potential positive implications of genetic testing for complex disease on behavior change.",2018,,Health Psychology,37,12,1134-1144,,10.1037/hea0000683,,#456,Frieser 2018
Embase,Principles of OCTA and Applications in Clinical Neurology,"WylÄ™gaÅ‚a, A.","Purpose of Review: The article reviews the recent findings on the use of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in neurology. Recent Findings: OCTA is a new addition to the powerful and complementary technology of the OCT. Due to its noninvasiveness, and reproducibility, it is possible to obtain high-resolution 3D images of the vessels of the human eye. As the vessels of the retina with the presence of endothelial cellâ€™s tight junctions resemble the brain vessels, it was hypothesized that the imaging of the retinal vessels might bring insight into brain vessels. OCTA has been effectively used to predict retinal vessel abnormalities in dementia, demyelization, optic disc neuropathies, and inherited degenerative diseases. Most common findings were decrease of vascular density and flow and an increase of avascular zones. Summary: Although OCTA is a relative new technology, recent studies show that it can be successfully applied in neurology.",2018,,Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports,18,12,,,10.1007/s11910-018-0911-x,,#455,WylÄ™gaÅ‚a 2018

Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to quantify the associations as presented in the literature and to also provide this information to healthcare professionals and patients about their potentially adverse effects. In July 2016, we searched through Medline (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception using common keywords. We included observational studies that provided risk estimates on the long-term use of PPIs and their adverse effects. Overall, 43 studies were included in the systematic review, of which 28 studies were also included in the random effect meta-analysis. Odds of community-acquired pneumonia, hip fracture, and colorectal cancer were 67% [odds ratio (OR)=1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.67], 42% (OR=1.42; 95% CI: 1.33-1.53), and 55% (OR=1.55; 95% CI: 0.88-2.73) higher in patients with long-term PPIs use compared with patients who did not use PPIs. Although the use of PPIs provides short-term health benefits, their prolonged use is associated with minor and also potentially major adverse health outcomes. Hence, we strongly recommend that the prescription of PPIs should be done with caution to improve the medication's efficacy and patients' safety.",2018,,European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,30,12,1395-1405,,10.1097/MEG.0000000000001198,,#454,Islam 2018
Embase,Language disorders in huntington disease: A systematic literature review,"Gagnon, M.; Barrette, J.; MacOir, J.","Objective: A systematic review examining the presence and nature of language disorders associated with Huntington disease (HD). Background: HD is characterized by gradual motor dysfunction, psychiatric problems, and cognitive decline. Communication abilities in HD may be affected not only by dysarthria but also by language impairment. However, the nature and type of this impairment is not well defined. Methods: We searched the PubMed and PsycINFO databases and selected studies on the basis of the original language of the article, peer-review status, and specificity of the results regarding language and communication disorders. Results: Thirty-one articles meeting the selection criteria were selected for this review. According to most of the studies, individuals with HD present with primary deficits of language. However, a few authors suggested that language deficits in HD result from nonlinguistic impairments, or that language abilities are largely preserved. More specifically, studies showed that HD is associated with difficulties in producing and understanding sentences and discourse, processing semantic representations of object and action concepts, retrieving lexical forms of nouns, and applying morphological and syntactic rules. There is some disagreement regarding whether HD affects reading abilities, sentence production, semantic processing, and application of morphological rules in verb conjugation. Conclusions: Although people with HD present with language impairment, further studies are needed to identify their functional origin. Clinical studies are also needed to determine the impact of such impairments on an individual's functional communication in daily living and to chart the progression of the impairments over the course of the disease.",2018,,Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology,31,4,179-192,,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000171,,#452,Gagnon 2018
Embase,The effects and potential mechanisms of folic acid on cognitive function: a comprehensive review,"Enderami, A.; Zarghami, M.; Darvishi-Khezri, H.","Cognitive impairment and dementia are major neurocognitive disorders that cause a noticeable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills. The effectiveness of using folic acid as an adjuvant for management of neurocognitive disorders is not well-known. This paper explains the role of folic acid, including its usefulness, effectiveness, adverse side effects, and active mechanisms on cognitive functions of the elderly. In the current study, we reviewed clinical and experimental studies investigating the use of folic acid prior to November 2017, using PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, Scopus, Ovid, and Cochrane Library databases. A total of 142 articles were retrieved by electronic search. Based on the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 36 articles were retrieved for full text analysis. According to data obtained from the review, it seems that folic acid supplementation may improve cognitive function by decreasing homocysteine (Hcy), vascular care, attenuating inflammatory status, modification of cerebral folic acid deficiency, and antioxidant responses. Specifically, people with high levels of Hcy have a better response to folic acid supplementation, which may arise from low serum folate concentration.",2018,,Neurological Sciences,39,10,1667-1675,,10.1007/s10072-018-3473-4,,#450,Enderami 2018
Embase,Clinical and Molecular Characteristics of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Rose, S.; Niyazov, D.M.; Rossignol, D.A.; Goldenthal, M.; Kahler, S.G.; Frye, R.E.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects ~ 2% of children in the United States. The etiology of ASD likely involves environmental factors triggering physiological abnormalities in genetically sensitive individuals. One of these major physiological abnormalities is mitochondrial dysfunction, which may affect a significant subset of children with ASD. Here we systematically review the literature on human studies of mitochondrial dysfunction related to ASD. Clinical aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD include unusual neurodevelopmental regression, especially if triggered by an inflammatory event, gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, motor delays, fatigue and lethargy. Traditional biomarkers of mitochondrial disease are widely reported to be abnormal in ASD, but appear non-specific. Newer biomarkers include buccal cell enzymology, biomarkers of fatty acid metabolism, non-mitochondrial enzyme function, apoptosis markers and mitochondrial antibodies. Many genetic abnormalities are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD, including chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial DNA mutations and large-scale deletions, and mutations in both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial nuclear genes. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in immune and buccal cells, fibroblasts, muscle and gastrointestinal tissue and theÂ brains of individuals with ASD. Several environmental factors, including toxicants, microbiome metabolites and an oxidized microenvironment are shown to modulate mitochondrial function in ASD tissues. Investigations of treatments for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD are promising but preliminary. The etiology of mitochondrial dysfunction and how to define it in ASD is currently unclear. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the mitochondria may be a fruitful target for treatment and prevention of ASD. Further research is needed to better understand the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of ASD.",2018,,Molecular Diagnosis and Therapy,22,5,571-593,,10.1007/s40291-018-0352-x,,#449,Rose 2018
Embase,"Diabetes Treatment in the Elderly: Incorporating Geriatrics, Technology, and Functional Medicine","Valencia, W.M.; Botros, D.; Vera-Nunez, M.; Dang, S.","Purpose of Review: The current approach to diabetes in the elderly incorporates components from the comprehensive geriatric approach. The most updated guidelines from the American Diabetes Association reflect influence from the consensus made in 2012 with the American Geriatrics Society. Notably, the framework included the evaluation for geriatric syndromes (falls and urinary incontinence), functional and cognitive abilities. The goal for this review is to provide an updated summary of treatment strategies for community-dwelling older adults. We identified the need to expand our approach by addressing innovative approaches and scientific concepts from telemedicine, functional medicine, and geriatrics. Recent Findings: Findings on cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and some glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) support their use for older patients with diabetes. However, careful consideration for agent selection must incorporate the presence of geriatric issues, such as geriatric syndromes, or functional and cognitive decline, as they could increase the risk and impact adverse reactions. Telemedicine interventions can improve communication and connection between older patients and their providers, and improve glycemic control. Functional medicine concepts can offer additional adjuvant strategies to support the therapeutic interventions and management of diabetes in the elderly. Summary: A systematic review confirmed the efficacy and safety of metformin as first-line therapy of type 2 diabetes in the older adult, but multiple reports highlighted the risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. Randomized controlled trials showed the efficacy and safety of antihyperglycemic agents in the elderly, including some with longer duration and lesser risk for hypoglycemia. Randomized clinical trials showed cardiovascular protection with SGLT-2i (empagliflozin, canagliflozin) and GLP-1RA (liraglutide, semaglutide). The most current guidelines recommend addressing for geriatric syndromes, physical and cognitive function in the elderly, in order to individualize targets and therapeutic strategies. Clinicians managing diabetes in the elderly can play a major role for the early detection and evaluation of geriatric issues in their patients. Telemedicine interventions improve glycemic control, and certain functional medicine strategies could be adjuvant interventions to reduce inflammation and stress, but more studies focused on the elderly population are needed.",2018,,Current Diabetes Reports,18,10,,,10.1007/s11892-018-1052-y,,#448,Valencia 2018

Design: Systematic review of experimental (non-human) studies assessing cognitive effects of RAS peptides angiotensin-(3â€“8) [Ang IV] and angiotensin-(1â€“7) [Ang-(1â€“7)] and their receptors, the Ang IV receptor (AT4R) and the Mas receptor. Results: Of 450 articles identified, 32 met inclusion criteria. Seven of 11 studies of normal animals found Ang IV had beneficial effects on tests of passive or conditioned avoidance and object recognition. In models of cognitive deficit, eight of nine studies found Ang IV and its analogs (Nle1-Ang IV, dihexa, LVV-hemorphin-7) improved performance on spatial working memory and passive avoidance tasks. Two of three studies examining Ang-(1â€“7) found it benefited memory. Mas receptor removal was associated with reduced fear memory in one study. Conclusion: Studies of cognitive impairment show salutary effects of acute administration of Ang IV and its analogs, as well as AT4R activation.

Methods: Studies were identified through a systematic search of online scientific databases, in addition to a manual search of the reference lists from the identified papers. Results: Air pollution is a multifaceted toxic chemical mixture capable of assaulting the central nervous system. Despite being a relatively new area of investigation, overall, there is mounting evidence implicating adverse effects of air pollution on cognitive function in both adults and children. Conclusions: Consistent evidence showed that exposure to air pollution, specifically exposure to particulate matter, caused poor age-related cognitive performance.

Meta-analyses were conducted for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scaleâ€“cognitive subscale and/or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate treatment effects. Results: Thirty randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine compared TMs with donepezil. Single studies provided comparisons with galantamine, rivastigmine, or memantine. There were no significant differences between the TM and donepezil groups at 12 or 24Â weeks for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale or MMSE. Improvements over baseline were significant for MMSE at 12 and 24Â weeks within the TM and donepezil groups and remained significant at 1Â year. Effect sizes were reduced in the 3 double-blind studies. At 24Â weeks, donepezil 10Â mg/d generally produced greater improvements in MMSE than 5Â mg/d. Tolerability reporting was incomplete and inconsistent between studies. Conclusions: The results suggested that the clinical benefits of the TMs were not less than donepezil at comparable time points, with both groups showing improvements. However, lack of blinding in most studies and other design and measurement issues are likely to have resulted in overestimation of effect sizes in both groups.

On a global scale, family and other unpaid care predominates. Supporting caregivers is crucial, but scalable interventions are currently lacking. Because a growing number of studies have suggested that online training and support programs hold considerable promise for scaling up, we reviewed existing literature. Methods: We systematically searched 6 databases to identify studies of Internet-based interventions designed to train and support caregivers of people with dementia, and we formally assessed risk of bias. Our prespecified primary outcomes of interest included both mental health and caregiver burden/perceived stress. Our secondary outcomes of interest included knowledge, quality of life of caregivers, quality of care, caregiver response to challenging behaviors, coping, and self-efficacy. Results: Eight randomized control trials met our inclusion criteria involving over 900 participants. The content and structure of Internet-based interventions, outcome measures, and duration differed markedly, and selection, performance, and reporting biases were varied and on occasion of concern. Six studies reported outcomes in caregivers' mental health outcomes, 3 studies reported burden outcomes. Three studies reported knowledge skills, quality of life and reaction to challenging behaviours, whereas 2 studies reported changes in coping outcomes and self-efficacy. No studies reported outcomes on quality of care. Discussion: Although there is some evidence that Internet-based interventions can improve mental health outcomes for informal caregivers of people with dementia, marked methodological diversity across studies prevented the robust pooling of the results.

Embase,Neuropsychiatric symptoms as prognostic makers for the elderly with mild cognitive impairment: a meta-analysis,"Hu, M.; Shu, X.; Wu, X.; Chen, F.; Hu, H.; Zhang, J.; Yan, P.; Feng, H.","Background: Although several neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) have been demonstrated to have value in the prediction of the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, these symptoms are less studied for the prediction of the transition from normal cognition (NC) to MCI. Methods: Prospective cohort studies were included if they reported on at least one NPS at baseline and had MCI as the outcome. Results: We obtained 13 cohort studies with a total population of 33,066. Depression was the most common neuropsychiatric symptom and could significantly predict transition to MCI (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13â€“1.86). However, depression was more capable of predicting amnestic MCI (RR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.04-1.83) than non-aMCI (RR= 0.96, 95% CI 95% CI: 0.60-1.33). Subgroup analysis suggested that the association between depression and MCI changed with depression severity, depression criteria, apolipoprotein-E-adjusted status, age, the percentage of females, and follow-up times, but some data were too sparse for a reliable estimate. Regarding other NPSs, there were insufficient data to assess their effect on the development of MCI. However, apathy, anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and agitation might be risk factors for the prediction of NC-MCI transition with strong predictive value.

Methods: A systematic search of meta-analyses was conducted. Scopus, Web of Science, Science direct, PubMed and Google academic system databases were reviewed. Results: We found 100 primary studies and five meta-analyses to analyze the relationships between cholesterol and AD. The total effect of cholesterol on risk of AD was significant and heterogeneous. Subgroup analysis shows that LDL-C levels influence the development of AD. However, non-significant effects of HDL-C, TC and TG levels on AD were found.

Embase,The role of virtual reality in improving health outcomes for community-dwelling older adults: Systematic review,"Dermody, G.; Whitehead, L.; Wilson, G.; Glass, C.","Background: Virtual reality (VR) delivered through immersive headsets creates an opportunity to deliver interventions to improve physical, mental, and psychosocial health outcomes. VR app studies with older adults have primarily focused on rehabilitation and physical function including gait, balance, fall prevention, pain management, and cognition. Several systematic reviews have previously been conducted, but much of the extant literature is focused on rehabilitation or other institutional settings, and little is known about the effectiveness of VR apps using immersive headsets to target health outcomes among community-dwelling older adults. Objective: The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of VR apps delivered using commercially available immersive headsets to improve physical, mental, or psychosocial health outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: Peer-reviewed publications that included community-dwelling older adults aged â‰¥60 years residing in residential aged care settings and nursing homes were included. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for systematic reviews of effectiveness evidence. The title of this review was registered with JBI, and the systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Results: In total, 7 studies that specifically included community-dwelling older adults were included in this review. VR apps using a head-mounted display led to improvements in a number of health outcomes, including pain management, posture, cognitive functioning specifically related to Alzheimer disease, and a decreased risk of falls. A total of 6 studies reported a statistically significant difference post VR intervention, and 1 study reported an improvement in cognitive function to reduce navigational errors. Only one study reported on the usability and acceptability of the interventions delivered through VR. While one study used a distraction mechanism for pain management, none of the studies used gaming technology to promote enjoyment. Conclusions: Interventions to improve health outcomes through VR have demonstrated potential; however, the ability to synthesize findings by primary outcome for the older adult population is not possible. A number of factors, especially related to frailty, usability, and acceptability, also need to be explored before more substantial recommendations on the effectiveness of VR interventions for older adults can be made.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,6,,,10.2196/17331,,#702,Dermody 2020

Although the scientific community has shown interest in MCI, the forensic implications of MCI have been poorly investigated. Forensic implications are huge, affecting all aspects of the so-called ability to act. health care professionals, and, more often, forensic experts, have to discriminate if MCI patients sufficiently perform in different actions with important legal relapses. But the question is: are there means or parameters you may use in order to decide about Mci subjectsâ€™ competence? the primary aim of the article was to describe the state of the art providing a systematic review of the scientific literature on decision-making capacity.

Embase,Cognition-Oriented Treatments for Older Adults: a Systematic Overview of Systematic Reviews,"Gavelin, H.M.; Lampit, A.; Hallock, H.; SabatÃ©s, J.; Bahar-Fuchs, A.","Cognition-oriented treatments - commonly categorized as cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation - are promising approaches for the prevention of cognitive and functional decline in older adults. We conducted a systematic overview of meta-analyses investigating the efficacy of cognition-oriented treatments on cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes in older adults with or without cognitive impairment. Review quality was assessed by A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR). We identified 51 eligible reviews, 46 of which were included in the quantitative synthesis. The confidence ratings were ""moderate"" for 9 (20%), ""low"" for 13 (28%) and ""critically low"" for 24 (52%) of the 46 reviews. While most reviews provided pooled effect estimates for objective cognition, non-cognitive outcomes of potential relevance were more sparsely reported. The mean effect estimate on cognition was small for cognitive training in healthy older adults (mean Hedges' gâ€‰=â€‰0.32, range 0.13-0.64, 19 reviews), mild cognitive impairment (mean Hedges' gâ€‰=â€‰0.40, range 0.32-0.60, five reviews), and dementia (mean Hedges' gâ€‰=â€‰0.38, range 0.09-1.16, seven reviews), and small for cognitive stimulation in dementia (mean Hedges' gâ€‰=â€‰0.36, range 0.26-0.44, five reviews). Meta-regression revealed that higher AMSTAR score was associated with larger effect estimates for cognitive outcomes. The available evidence supports the efficacy of cognition-oriented treatments improving cognitive performance in older adults. The extent to which such effects are of clinical value remains unclear, due to the scarcity of high-quality evidence and heterogeneity in reported findings. An important avenue for future trials is to include relevant non-cognitive outcomes in a more consistent way and, for meta-analyses in the field, there is a need for better adherence to methodological standards.Â PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018084490.",2020,,Neuropsychology review,30,2,167-193,,10.1007/s11065-020-09434-8,,#700,Gavelin 2020

Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, we undertook comprehensive systematic reviews using the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science databases. Results: We identified and critically appraised 39 articles for autonomic dysfunction and 5 for sudden death that satisfied the eligibility criteria. Following thematic analysis, we identified 7 themes: breathing irregularities, abnormal spontaneous brainstem activations, heart rate variability metrics, QTc changes, vagal imbalance, fluc-tuation in peptides and serotonergic neurotransmission. We grouped these 7 themes into 3 final themes: (A) brainstem modulation of breathing, (B) electrical instability of the cardiovascular system and (C) neurochemical changes contributing to autonomic decline. We described key evidence relating to each theme and identified important areas that could improve the clinical management of patients with RTT. Limitations: The heterogeneity of the methods used to assess autonomic function increased the difficulty of making infer-ences from the different studies. Conclusion: This study identified the important mediators of autonomic dysfunction and sudden death in patients with RTT. We proposed brainstem mechanisms and emphasized risk factors that increase brainstem vulnerability. We dis-cussed clinical management to reduce sudden death and future directions for this vulnerable population.",2020,,Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience,45,3,150-181,,10.1503/jpn.190033,,#697,Singh 2020
Embase,Current synthesis and systematic review of main effects of calf blood deproteinized medicine (ActoveginÂ® ) in ischemic stroke,"Firan, F.C.; Romila, A.; Onose, G.","Background: Stroke is one of the largest problems and clinical-social challenges within neurology and, in general, pathology. Here, we briefly reviewed the main pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemic stroke, which represent targets for medical interventions, including for a calf blood deproteinized hemodialysate/ultrafiltrate. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of current related literature concerning the effects of ActoveginÂ®, of mainly the pleiotropic type, applied to the injury pathways of ischemic stroke. Results: The bibliographic resources regarding the use of ActoveginÂ® in ischemic stroke are scarce. The main ActoveginÂ® actions refer to the ischemic stroke lesion itemsâ€™ ensemble, targeting tissue oxidation, energy metabolism, and glucose availability through their augmentation, combating ischemic processes and oxidative stress, and decreasing inflammation (including with modulatory connotations, by the nuclear factor-ÎºB pathway) and apoptosis-like processes, counteracting them by mitigating the caspase-3 activation induced by amyloid Î_-peptides. Conclusion: Since no available therapeutic agents are capable of curing the central nervous systemâ€™s lesions, any contribution, such as that of ActoveginÂ® (with consideration of a positive balance between benefits and risks), is worthy of further study and periodic reappraisal, including investigation into further connected aspects.",2020,,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,21,9,,,10.3390/ijms21093181,,#696,Firan 2020

Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for prospective population-based studies addressing associations of white matter hyperintensities, covert brain infarcts (i.e., clinically silent infarcts), and cerebral microbleeds with risk of all-dementia or Alzheimer's disease and performed meta-analyses. Results: We identified 11 studies on white matter hyperintensities, covert brain infarcts, or cerebral microbleeds with risk of all-dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Pooled analyses showed an association of white matter hyperintensity volume and a borderline association of covert brain infarcts with risk of all-dementia (hazard ratio: 1.39 [95% confidence interval: 1.00; 1.94], N = 3913, and 1.47 [95% confidence interval: 0.97; 2.22], N = 8296). Microbleeds were not statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of all-dementia (hazard ratio: 1.25 [95% confidence interval: 0.66; 2.38], N = 8739).

Embase,Barriers and facilitators of engaging community health workers in non-communicable disease (Ncd) prevention and control in china: A systematic review (2006â€“2016),"Long, H.; Huang, W.; Zheng, P.; Li, J.; Tao, S.; Tang, S.; Abdullah, A.S.","Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a dominant disease burden in China. Although China has a prevention-centered NCD strategy, the implementation effect in the community has been subjected to manpower and financial difficulties. Engaging community health workers (CHWs) in community-based interventions may be a cost-effective approach to relieve the resource shortage and improve health. This review aimed to synthesize evidence on types of NCD-related care that was provided by CHWs in China, and to identify relevant barriers and facilitators. Methods: A literature search was conducted in Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases for English-written, peer-reviewed articles published from 1996 to 2016 that reported findings from NCD-related interventions delivered by CHWs in China. Each article was extracted independently by two researchers. Results: Twenty distinct studies met the inclusion criteria. The two most common types of CHW-led NCD-related care were diabetes and hypertension management (n = 7) and mental health care (n = 7). Thirteen studies discussed the barriers and 16 studies reported facilitators. The most common barriers included lack of support (n = 6), lack of resources (n = 4), and heavy reliance on technology (n = 4). The common facilitators included an integrated health system (n = 9), community and patient trust (n = 5), high quality training (n = 5), and CHWsâ€™ capacity (n = 5). Fourteen studies mentioned training content, while only eight described detailed procedures and duration. Conclusions: This review suggests that trained and supervised Chinese CHWs had the capacity to provide grassroots NCDs preventive interventions. In order to increase the generalizability and sustainability of such programs, studies with robust designs are needed to explore the effectiveness of CHW-led programs, and the intervention strategies to improve the practice of CHWs in various settings.",2018,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,15,11,,,10.3390/ijerph15112378,,#689,Long 2018
Embase,Effects of exercise interventions for specific cognitive domains in old adults with mild cognitive impairment: A protocol of subgroup meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Zhou, X.-L.; Wang, L.-N.; Wang, J.; Shen, X.-H.; Zhao, X.","Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the clinical prognosis that leads to dementia. Early intervention of MCI is critical to protect against dementia. Exercise intervention has gained popularity for the management of MCI. Most current studies have focused only on improvements made by exercise interventions on the global/general cognitive function and/or a specific cognitive function. However, no studies have been performed on a subgroup analysis of the effects of exercise interventions on different cognitive domains of the elderly with MCI. The exploration of this issue will help to clarify the influence and through a preliminary analysis identify the level of influence of exercise interventions on particular cognitive domains, and it will provide the theoretical framework for the construction of precise exercise intervention strategies for MCI patients. Methods:A systematic review of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, the Wan Fang Database, and CBM), supplemented by expert contact, reference and citation checking, and gray literature searches have been conducted. There is no restriction on language or publication status.

Primary outcomes of interest are standardized measurements of executive functions, memory, language, processing speed, and attention. If possible, we conduct a meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence for each outcome. Results: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence of exercise for MCI patients. Conclusion: The conclusion of this systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether exercise is an effective intervention for patient with MCI and preliminary ranking of the effects of exercise on specific cognitive domains.

Embase,Negative effects of psychotherapies for adult depression: A meta-analysis of deterioration rates,"Cuijpers, P.; Reijnders, M.; Karyotaki, E.; de Wit, L.; Ebert, D.D.","Background: The risk for deterioration in patients receiving psychotherapy for adult depression has not been examined extensively and it is not clear whether psychotherapy reduces this risk or may even increase it in some patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of trials comparing these psychotherapies with control conditions that report deterioration rates. Methods: We used an existing database of randomized trials on psychotherapies for adult depression which was updated up to 1/1/2017, through systematic searches in bibliographic databases. We included trials that reported clinically significant deterioration rates. Results: We included 18 studies with 23 comparisons between therapy and control groups. The pooled risk ratio of deterioration was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.27âˆ_0.57), indicating that patients in the psychotherapy groups have a 61% lower chance to deteriorate than patients in the control groups. We found that 20 patients need to be treated with psychotherapy in order to avoid one case of deterioration, compared to the control conditions. The median deterioration rate in the therapy groups was 4%, and in some studies more than 10%, indicating that clinicians should always be aware of the risk of deterioration. Limitations: The results should be considered with caution because most studies had at least some risk of bias. Only 6% of all trials comparing psychotherapy with a control condition reported deterioration rates, using different ways to define deterioration which made pooling the prevalence rates across treatments and control groups impossible. Conclusions: Psychological treatments of adult depression may reduce the risk for deterioration, compared to control groups, but this should be considered with caution because of the small proportion of studies reporting deterioration rates.",2018,,Journal of Affective Disorders,239,"(Cuijpers P., p.cuijpers@vu.nl; Reijnders M.; Karyotaki E.; de Wit L.)

Embase,The relationship between neurocognitive decline and the heart-lung machine,"Tamargo, C.L.; Botros, M.; Saveanu, R.V.","Surgery involving the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has long been associated with cerebral changes and may also contribute to adverse neurocognitive outcomes. However, there is a debate as to whether bypass itself is responsible for these changes. We conducted a systematic literature review on PubMed, supplementing our work with recent articles from other sources to examine the current evidence on neurocognitive decline associated with CPB. While surgeries involving CPB appear to be associated with cerebral changes and potentially with neurocognitive decline, it is unclear as to whether decline is related to the procedure itself. It is possible that the impacts of CPB can be more readily observed among individuals with preoperative cognitive impairment. It is thus important to screen for subtle and more apparent preoperative cognitive impairment as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. Further research, comparing on-pump and off-pump cohorts and involving intensive screening of preoperative cognitive decline, is indicated to elucidate the true neurocognitive consequences of the heart-lung machine.",2020,,Journal of Cardiac Surgery,35,5,1057-1061,,10.1111/jocs.14505,,#684,Tamargo 2020
Embase,"Protective effects of lycopene in cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases: An update on epidemiological and mechanistic perspectives","Saini, R.K.; Rengasamy, K.R.R.; Mahomoodally, F.M.; Keum, Y.-S.","Recent mechanistic and epidemiological studies have provided insights into health benefits of dietary lycopene to decrease the risk and complications associated with several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. These chronic diseases are primarily associated with oxidative stress-induced systemic and low-grade chronic inflammation. Owing to its potent antioxidant properties, lycopene can potentially alleviate enhanced levels of proinflammatory mediators (e.g., proinflammatory cytokines IL-8, -6, and -1, and oxidized phospholipids) and prevent NF-ÎºB activation by modulating oxidative stress. Moreover, lycopene serves as a precursor for various oxidative cleavage products and metabolites including Apo-8â€™-, apo-10â€™-, and apo-12â€™-lycopenals that can interact with multiple transcription factors (e.g., Nrf2, RARs, RXRs, and PPARs) to overexpress antioxidant and cytoprotective Phase II enzymes and other growth-stimulating proteins (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) for enhanced neuroprotection. These events altogether can protect the body from chronic inflammatory disorders. In the present review, the latest mechanistic development from cell and animal models and results of case-control, cohort, and randomized trials are discussed to support the protective part of lycopene in cancer, CVD, and neurodegenerative disorders. This review focuses on cellular and molecular events involved in protective effects of lycopene. Although molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in health-promoting activities of lycopene have been reported, no detailed mechanistic studies have been published. Hence, future studies should be conducted to elucidate the mechanistic role(s) of lycopene-derived oxidation products in modulating cellular signaling.",2020,,Pharmacological Research,155,"(Saini R.K.; Rengasamy K.R.R., Rengasamy@iceir.net) Department of Bioresources and Food Science, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea(Saini R.K.)

Embase,"Systematic review of acceptability, cardiovascular, neurological, bone health and HRT outcomes following risk reducing surgery in BRCA carriers","Gaba, F.; Manchanda, R.","Primary surgical prevention in the form of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is the most effective option and the gold standard for ovarian cancer (OC) risk-reduction, particularly given the absence of an effective national OC screening programme. However, premenopausal RRSO leads to premature surgical menopause with detrimental long-term health sequelae particularly in women who do not/are unable to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT uptake in women undergoing pre-menopausal oophorectomy appears low and is dependent on informed counselling, the safety of HRT and efficacy in mitigating the health sequelae of premature menopause. Acceptance of a central role for the fallopian tube in OC etiopathogenesis, coupled with the detrimental consequences of premature menopause, has led to the attractive proposal of early-salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy as an alternative OC surgical prevention strategy in premenopausal women who have completed childbearing but decline or wish to delay RRSO. The successful implementation of risk reducing surgery for OC prevention depends on the acceptability of surgery to both, recipients (e.g. BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers) and intervention deliverers (healthcare professionals/researchers). Acceptability is also informed by an understanding of health outcomes following risk reducing surgery and the safety of HRT. It is therefore vital to understand the effects of surgery on important health outcomes such as cardiovascular health, neurological function and bone health.

Nine electronic databases were searched for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods primary research studies. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, full texts of eligible studies, and conducted quality appraisal of included articles. A convergent qualitative synthesis approach was used.Results: From 7496 articles, 35 papers representing 32 studies from 1986 to 2017 were included. Studies originated from 13 countries across 4 continents. Barriers and facilitators were reported predominantly by carers. A small number of studies included people with dementia. Barriers included denial, stigma and fear, lack of knowledge, normalization of symptoms, preserving autonomy, lack of perceived need, unaware of changes, lack of informal network support, carer difficulties, and problems accessing help. Facilitators included recognition of symptoms as a problem, prior knowledge and contacts, and support from informal network.Conclusions: Studies from a 30-year period demonstrated that barriers to help seeking persist globally, despite increasing numbers of national dementia policies. Barriers and facilitators rarely existed independently demonstrating the complexity of help seeking for a diagnosis of dementia. Multiple barriers compounded the decision-making process and more than one facilitator was often required to overcome them. Multi-faceted interventions to reduce barriers are needed, one approach would be a focus on the development of dementia friendly communities to reduce stigma and empower people with dementia and carers.",2020,,International Psychogeriatrics,32,5,611-634,,10.1017/S1041610219002229,,#678,Parker 2020

The role of beta-amyloid (AÎ_) is at the center of investigations trying to discover the disease pathogenesis and to develop drugs for treatment or prevention on Alzheimer's disease. This review summarizes both physiological and pathological functions of AÎ_ and factors that may participate in the disease development. Known genetic factors are trisomy of chromosome 21, mutations of presenilin 1 and 2, and apolipoprotein E4. Lifetime stresses that increase the risk of development of Alzheimer's disease are described. Another important factor is the level of education, especially of linguistic ability. Lifestyle factors include mental and physical exercise, head injury, social contacts, and diet. All these factors might potentiate the effect of aging on the brain to increase the risk of development of pathological changes. The review summarizes pathological features of Alzheimer brain, AÎ_ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, and brain atrophy. Consequences of Alzheimer's disease that are reviewed include cognitive deficit, loss of function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Because there is no effective treatment, many persons with Alzheimer's disease survive to severe and terminal stages which they may fear. Alzheimer's disease at this stage should be considered a terminal disease for which palliative care is indicated. Importance of advance directives, promoting previous wishes of the person who was developing dementia and who subsequently lost decision-making capacity, and limitations of these directives are discussed.

A meta-analysis,"Gao, C.; Meng, J.; Xiao, X.; Wang, M.; Williams, A.B.; Wang, H.","Objectives: Although effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been used for more than two decades, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder remains prevalent. Thus, whether ART can improve neurocognitive impairment is controversial. This review aims to explore the effects of ART on cognitive impairment in people living with HIV (PLWH). Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in eight databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, China Biology Medicine disc, and WanFang) to identify studies that compare cognitive function between study groups who are administered and not administered ART. We searched for articles published up to April 2019. Article evaluation and data extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers. Results: Sixteen articles (6,694 participants)â€”14 cross-sectional studies and 2 cohort studiesâ€”were included in this meta-analysis. The cross-sectional studies demonstrated that ART group did not perform better than the non-ART group (OR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03â€“1.30).

Embase,Are the protective benefits of vitamin D in neurodegenerative disease dependent on route of administration? A systematic review,"Iacopetta, K.; Collins-Praino, L.E.; Buisman-Pijlman, F.T.A.; Liu, J.; Hutchinson, A.D.; Hutchinson, M.R.","Background: The clinical and preclinical exploration of the therapeutic properties of vitamin D have significantly increased in the past decade, owing to the growing associative evidence suggesting vitamin D is neuroprotective. However, whether depletion of vitamin D contributes to the onset of neurological disorders or is a symptom of neurological disease has yet to be defined. Much remains unclear about the causal role of vitamin D and the method of use and forms of vitamin D. Objectives: We sought to quantitatively assess if neuroprotective benefits from vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases are dependent on route of administration: comparing the effect of endogenously sourced vitamin D from UV exposure to exogenously derived vitamin D through synthetic supplementation. Design: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo databases which included both pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases. Articles were subject to strict inclusion criteria and objectively assessed for quality. Additionally, Medline data was analysed to identify trends in topic publications and linguistic characteristics of papers. Results: From a total of 231 screened articles, we identified 73 appropriate for review based on inclusion criteria: original studies that investigated vitamin D levels or levels of vitamin D supplementation in neurodegenerative diseases or investigated past/present sun exposure in disease cohorts. Results indicate there is insufficient evidence to comprehensively reflect on a potential neuroprotective role for vitamin D and if this was dependent on route of administration. The majority of current data supporting neuroprotective benefits from vitamin D are based on pre-clinical and observational studies. Solid evidence is lacking to support the current hypothesis that the beneficial effect of UV exposure results from the synthesis of vitamin D. Sun exposure, independent of vitamin D production, may be protective against multiple Sclerosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Yet, further research is required to elucidate the beneficial mechanism of actions of UV exposure. The literature of vitamin D and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was limited, and no conclusions were drawn. Therefore, in cases where UV-derived vitamin D was hypothesized to be the beneficial mediator in the neuroprotective effects of sun exposure, we propose results are based only on associative evidence. Conclusion: On the basis of this systematic review, strong recommendations regarding therapeutic benefits of vitamin D in neurodegenerative disease cannot be made. It is unclear if vitamin D mediates a protective benefit in neurodegenerative disease or whether it is an associative marker of UV exposure, which may contribute to as of yet unidentified neuroprotective factors.",2020,,Nutritional Neuroscience,23,4,251-280,,10.1080/1028415X.2018.1493807,,#672,Iacopetta 2020

Embase,Do post-translational modifications influence protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases: A systematic review,"Schaffert, L.-N.; Carter, W.G.","The accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates represents a universal hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate protein structure and function. Dysregulated PTMs may influence the propensity for protein aggregation in NDD-proteinopathies. To investigate this, we systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate effects of PTMs on aggregation propensity for major proteins linked to the pathogenesis and/or progression of NDDs. A search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection was conducted to retrieve studies that investigated an association between PTMs and protein aggregation in seven NDDs: Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), Huntingtonâ€™s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinocerebellar ataxias, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, and multiple sclerosis. Together, 1222 studies were identified, of which 69 met eligibility criteria. We identified that the following PTMs, in isolation or combination, potentially act as modulators of proteinopathy in NDDs: Isoaspartate formation in AÎ_, phosphorylation of AÎ_ or tau in AD; acetylation, 4-hydroxy-2-neonal modification, OGlcNAcylation or phosphorylation of Î±-synuclein in PD; acetylation or phosphorylation of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 in ALS, and SUMOylation of superoxide dismutase-1 in ALS; and phosphorylation of huntingtin in HD. The potential pharmacological manipulation of these aggregation-modulating PTMs represents an as-yet untapped source of therapy to treat NDDs.",2020,,Brain Sciences,10,4,,,10.3390/brainsci10040232,,#669,Schaffert 2020

However, the available evidence on the prevention of cognitive impairment and/or dementia is contradictory. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the role of physical activity in the prevention of cognitive impairment and/or dementia in older adults. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for the Medline, PsycINFO and SciELO databases. The search was focused on older adults over the age of 50, cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Results: 40 articles met our inclusion criteria. There is evidence to suggest that physical activity positively affects cognitive functioning, such as global cognition, memory, attention, executive functions. The majority of the included studies resulted in improvements of the assessed cognitive outcome measures. However, there is heterogeneity in the studies design. Conclusions: In general, the findings of our review suggest that physical exercise can provide a widely available strategy to improve cognitive functioning, especially of executive functions and memory, and delay the onset of dementia. The heterogeneity of the studies published so far does not allow us to define a formal recommendation about which would be the best proposals for approach in routine clinical practice.",2020,,Neurologia Argentina,12,2,124-137,,10.1016/j.neuarg.2020.01.003,,#667,Russo 2020

Embase,Visual art therapy as a treatment option for cognitive decline among older adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Masika, G.M.; Doris, Y.S.F.; Li, P.W.C.","AIMS: To investigate the effects of visual art therapy on cognitive and psychological outcomes and explore the crucial design characteristics of visual art therapy that might be associated with greater cognitive benefits among older adults. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Peer reviewed articles were searched from Medline, EMBASE, Global Health, Cochrane Library, Ovid Nursing database, PsycINFO, British Nursing Index and CINAHL Complete from inception of the databases to September 2019. REVIEW METHODS: This review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to examine the risk of bias of the studies. Narrative synthesis and quantitative meta-analysis were performed. RESULT: Twelve articles published between 2004 - 2019 involving 831 participants were identified. Visual art therapy significantly improved global cognitive function compared with different control groups (Hedges' gÂ =Â 0.348 (95%CIÂ =Â 0.026-0.671), pÂ =Â .034, I2 Â =Â 66.570%). Visual art therapy also demonstrated psychological benefits in reducing depressive symptoms and anxiety. By systematic comparison of the intervention designs, it seems that those with greater cognitive benefit involved a higher level of creativity and optimized the use of essential components including art-education, reminiscence, art-processing, cognitive evaluation, art-crafts/modelling and socialization. CONCLUSION: Visual art therapy could be effective in improving cognitive functions and the associated psychological symptoms. Therefore, it can be adopted as an effective non-pharmacological intervention for preventing cognitive decline and dementia. IMPACT: This review answers the key question regarding the pooled effect of visual art therapy as non-pharmacological therapy on preventing or managing dementia. In addition, it informs on the design characteristics of an effective visual art therapy for implementing among older adults.

Embase,The financial and social costs of delirium,"Caplan, G.A.; Teodorczuk, A.; Streatfeild, J.; Agar, M.R.","Purpose: Delirium is common with serious short- and long-term sequelae. However, there are no licensed treatments internationally and relatively little biomedical discovery with the target of finding a cure, with the invisibility or underestimation of the economic implications as a potential driver for this inertia. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of published literature in English quantitatively evaluating the financial and social costs of delirium to the health and care systems, patients and their carers. Results: Delirium increases the cost of the index hospitalisation as well as increasing the need for post-acute care and the demands on unpaid, often older, carers. Delirium may cause as much as 10% of all cases of dementia and the ongoing need for care of these people with dementia doubles the cost of delirium. Prevention of delirium not only reduces the cost of delirium but also may decrease subsequent rate of dementia. Conclusion: The high cost of delirium itself as well as the resultant dementia warrants greater efforts to prevent delirium and discover effective treatment.",2020,,European Geriatric Medicine,11,1,105-112,,10.1007/s41999-019-00257-2,,#653,Caplan 2020

Observational studies and randomized trials show that the use of antihypertensive therapy is associated with a lesser incidence or prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia. However, whether antihypertensive agents specifically target the pathological process of AD remains elusive. Areas covered: This review of literature provides an update on the clinical and preclinical arguments supporting anti-AD properties of antihypertensive drugs. The authors focused on validated all classes of antihypertensive treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), Î_-blockers, diuretics, neprilysin inhibitors, and other agents. Three main mechanisms can be advocated: action on the concurrent vascular pathology, action on the vascular component of Alzheimerâ€™s pathophysiology, and action on nonvascular targets. Expert opinion: In 2019, while there is no doubt that hypertension should be treated in primary prevention of vascular disease and in secondary prevention of stroke and mixed dementia, the place of antihypertensive agents in the secondary prevention of â€˜pureâ€™ AD remains an outstanding question.",2020,,Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,20,2,175-187,,10.1080/14737175.2020.1708195,,#652,Lebouvier 2020

Current antipsychotic medications do not alleviate these cognitive deficits, and more effective therapeutic options are required. Increased oxidative stress and altered antioxidant levels, including glutathione (GSH) have been observed both in individuals with cognitive impairment and in people with schizophrenia. A GSH precursor, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been investigated as a novel treatment for the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and recent research suggests that NAC may be a promising adjunctive treatment option. However, the current literature lacks integration as to why NAC may effectively improve cognition in schizophrenia. The present theoretical synthesis aimed to address this gap by examining the processes by which NAC may improve cognitive function in schizophrenia. Methods: The schizophrenia literature was reviewed in three key domains: cognitive impairment, the relationship between oxidative stress and cognition, and the efficacy of NAC as a novel treatment. This led to a theoretical analysis of the neurobiological processes by which NAC may improve cognition in schizophrenia. Results: This theoretical review concluded that improved cognition may result from a combination of factors, including decreased oxidative stress, neuroprotection of cognitive networks and an increase in glutamatergic modulation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor system. Whilst a number of mechanisms by which NAC may improve cognition and symptoms in schizophrenia have been proposed, there is still limited understanding of the specific metabolic pathways involved and how they interrelate and modify specific symptomology. Discussion: Exploration of how NAC treatment may act to improve cognitive function could guide clinical trials by investigation of the specific neurotransmitter systems and processes involved, allowing for targeted neurological outcome measures. Future research would benefit from the investigation of both in vivo cortical GSH concentration and peripheral plasma GSH in a population of individuals with chronic schizophrenia.",2020,,Nutritional Neuroscience,23,2,139-148,,10.1080/1028415X.2018.1478766,,#651,Yolland 2020

Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus including all studies published from 2000 to 2018 and written in English. Results: No consensus of the definition and diagnostic criteria for SBI was found. The prevalence of SBI in asymptomatic carotid patients is 17â€“33.3%.

Embase,Therapeutic approaches targeting Apolipoprotein e function in Alzheimer's disease,"Williams, T.; Borchelt, D.R.; Chakrabarty, P.","One of the primary genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of the Ïµ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE). APOE is a polymorphic lipoprotein that is a major cholesterol carrier in the brain. It is also involved in various cellular functions such as neuronal signaling, neuroinflammation and glucose metabolism. Humans predominantly possess three different allelic variants of APOE, termed E2, E3, and E4, with the E3 allele being the most common. The presence of the E4 allele is associated with increased risk of AD whereas E2 reduces the risk. To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie APOE-related genetic risk, considerable effort has been devoted towards developing cellular and animal models. Data from these models indicate that APOE4 exacerbates amyloid Î_ plaque burden in a dose-dependent manner. and may also enhance tau pathogenesis in an isoform-dependent manner. Other studies have suggested APOE4 increases the risk of AD by mechanisms that are distinct from modulation of AÎ_ or tau pathology. Further, whether plasma APOE, by influencing systemic metabolic pathways, can also possibly alter CNS function indirectly is not complete;y understood. Collectively, the available studies suggest that APOE may impact multiple signaling pathways and thus investigators have sought therapeutics that would disrupt pathological functions of APOE while preserving or enhancing beneficial functions. This review will highlight some of the therapeutic strategies that are currently being pursued to target APOE4 towards preventing or treating AD and we will discuss additional strategies that holds promise for the future.",2020,,Molecular Neurodegeneration,15,1,,,10.1186/s13024-020-0358-9,,#648,Williams 2020

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in most patients with AD, and depression is one of the most common AD-related BPSD. Kaixinsan (KXS) is an ancient Chinese herbal prescription widely used to treat dementia and forgetfulness. In this systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess preclinical evidence for the effects of KXS on cognitive impairment and depression. Thirty-eight articles involving 1,050 animals were included after searching from six databases from the inception up to June 2019. The primary outcome measures were behavioral outcome. Indicators of cognitive function in AD included escape latency, time spent on the target quadrant, and the number of target platform crossings in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Indicators of depression included number of rearing events and total distance in the open-field test, duration of immobility in the forced swim test, and sucrose consumption or sucrose preference index in the sucrose preference test. The secondary outcomes were mechanisms of KXS for treatment of AD and depression. The results showed that KXS significantly reduced escape latency (P < 0.01), increased time spent in the target quadrant (P < 0.01), and increased the number of target platform crossings (P < 0.01) in the MWM test in AD models compared with control. The possible mechanisms for KXS-mediated improvements in cognitive function were antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, antiapoptotic activity, neuroprotection, and synapse protection. In addition, the results demonstrated that KXS significantly increased the number of rearing instances (P < 0.01) in the open-field test, decreased the duration of immobility (P < 0.01) in forced swim test, and increased sucrose consumption or sucrose preference index (P < 0.01) in the sucrose preference test in depression models compared with control. The mechanisms of KXS-mediated anti-depressive effects were HPA axis regulation, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, synapse protection, and neuroprotection. The results of this study suggested that KXS can be used to effectively treat AD and depression through multiple mechanisms, extrapolating the therapeutic potential of KXS for treating AD-related BPSD.",2020,,Frontiers in Neuroscience,13,"(Fu H.; Xu Z.; Zhang X.-L.; Zheng G.-Q., gq_zheng@sohu.com) Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China",,,10.3389/fnins.2019.01421,,#645,Fu 2020

Despite the importance of early identification of mild cognitive impairment in PD, its prevalence and clinical correlates are still debated. The present meta-analysis provides a robust estimate of prevalence rate of mild cognitive impairment in PD according to the Movement Disorder Society clinical criteria and to explore the differences between PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment in demographic, clinical, and neuropsychiatric features. A systematic literature search was performed up to April 2019 using PsycInfo (PROQUEST), PubMed, and Scopus. From 4706 titles and abstracts, 41 studies were selected (n = 7053 patients).

Embase,Proteinuria as an independent predictor of stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Kelly, D.M.; Rothwell, P.M.","Background: Proteinuria has emerged as an important vascular risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events including stroke. Hypertension has been proposed as the principal confounder of this relationship but its role has not been systematically examined. Aim: We aimed to determine if proteinuria remains an independent predictor of stroke after more complete adjustment for blood pressure. Summary of review: We performed a systematic review, searching MEDLINE and EMBASE (to February 2018) for cohort studies or randomized controlled trials that reported stroke incidence in adults according to baseline proteinuria Â± glomerular filtration rate. Study and participant characteristics and relative risks were extracted. Estimates were combined using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by Ï‡2 statistics and I2, and by subgroup strata and meta-regression, with a particular focus on the impact of more complete adjustment for blood pressure on the association. The quality of cohort studies and post hoc analyses was assessed using the Newcastleâ€“Ottawa Scale. We identified 38 studies comprising 1,735,390 participants with 26,405 stroke events. Overall, the presence of any level of proteinuria was associated with greater stroke risk (18 studies; pooled crude relative risk 2.00, 95%CI 1.63â€“2.46; p < 0.001) even after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors (33 studies; pooled adjusted relative risk 1.72, 1.51â€“1.95; p < 0.001), albeit with considerable heterogeneity between studies (p < 0.001; I2= 77.3%). Moreover, the association did not substantially attenuate with more thorough adjustment for hypertension: single baseline blood pressure measure (10 studies; pooled adjusted relative risk = 1.92, 1.39â€“2.66; p < 0.001); history or treated hypertension (four studies; pooled adjusted relative risk = 1.76, 1.13â€“2.75, p = 0.013); multiple blood pressure measurements over months to years (four studies; relative risk = 1.68, 1.33â€“2.14; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Even after extensive adjustment for hypertension, proteinuria is strongly and independently associated with incident stroke risk, possibly indicating a shared renal and cerebral susceptibility to vascular injury that is not fully explained by traditional vascular risk factors.",2020,,International Journal of Stroke,15,1,29-38,,10.1177/1747493019895206,,#638,Kelly 2020

The expression and secretion of both molecules increase in response to neuronal damage and they exert protective and restorative effects, which may also be accompanied by adverse side effects. Objective: We review the most relevant evidence on the neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects of Epo and VEGF in three of the most frequent neurological disorders, namely, stroke, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, to develop new therapeutic approaches. Methods: Several original scientific manuscripts and reviews that have discussed the evidence in critical way, considering both the beneficial and adverse effects of Epo and VEGF in the selected neurological disorders, were analysed. In addition, throughout this review, we propose several considerations to take into account in the design of therapeutic approaches based on Epo and VEGF signalling. Results: Although the three selected disorders are triggered by different mechanisms, they evolve through similar processes: excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, neuronal death, glial reactivity and vascular re-modelling. Epo and VEGF exert neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects by acting on these processes due to their pleiotropism. In general, the evidence shows that both Epo and VEGF reduce neuronal death but that at the vascular level, their effects are contradictory. Conclusion: Because the Epo and VEGF signalling pathways are connected in several ways, we conclude that more experimental studies, primarily studies designed to thoroughly assess the functional interactions between Epo and VEGF in the brain under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions, are needed.",2020,,Current Pharmaceutical Design,26,12,1263-1276,,10.2174/1381612826666200114104342,,#635,UreÃ±a-Guerrero 2020

Aims: To provide the most current incidence, mortality and caseâ€“fatality data on stroke and describe current availability of stroke units around the world by country. Methods: We searched multiple databases (based on our existing search strategy) to identify new original manuscripts and review articles published between 1 June 2016 and 31 October 2018 that met the ideal criteria for data on stroke incidence and caseâ€“fatality. For data on the availability of hospital-based stroke services, we searched PubMed for all literature published up until 31 June 2018. We further screened reference lists, citation history of manuscripts and gray literature for this information. Mortality codes for International Classification of Diseases-9 and International Classification of Diseases-10 were extracted from the World Health Organization mortality database for each country providing these data. Population denominators were obtained from the World Health Organization, and when these were unavailable within a two-year period of mortality data, population denominators within a two-year period were obtained from the United Nations. Using country-specific population denominators and the most recent years of mortality data available for each country, we calculated both the crude mortality from stroke and mortality adjusted to the World Health Organization world population. Results: Since our last report in 2017, there were two countries with new incidence studies, China (n = 1) and India (n = 2) that met the ideal criteria. New data on caseâ€“fatality were found for Estonia and India. The most current mortality data were available for the year 2015 (39 countries), 2016 (43 countries), and 2017 (7 countries). No new data on mortality were available for six countries. Availability of stroke units was noted for 63 countries, and the proportion of patients treated in stroke units was reported for 35/63 countries.

Embase,Post-traumatic stress disorder mistaken for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: case series and recommendations of care,"Bruneau, M.-A.; Desmarais, P.; Pokrzywko, K.","In late life, traumas may act cumulatively to exacerbate vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is also a risk factor for cognitive decline. Major neurocognitive disorder (MND) can be associated with worsening of already controlled PTSD symptoms, late-life resurgence or de novo emergence. Misidentifying PTSD symptoms in MND can have negative consequences for the patient and families. We review the literature pertaining to PTSD and dementia and describe five cases referred for consultation in geriatric psychiatry initially for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), which were eventually diagnosed and treated as PTSD in MND subjects. We propose that certain PTSD symptoms in patients with MND are misinterpreted as BPSD and therefore, not properly addressed. For example, flashbacks could be interpreted as hallucinations, hypervigilance as paranoia, nightmares as sleep disturbances, and hyperreactivity as agitation/aggression. We suggest that better identification of PTSD symptoms in MND is needed. We propose specific recommendations for care, namely: clarifying diagnosis by distinguishing PTSD symptoms coexisting with different types of dementia from a specific dementia symptom (BPSD), gathering a detailed history of the trauma in order to personalise non-pharmacological interventions, adapting psychotherapeutic strategies to patients with dementia, using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line treatment and avoiding antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Proper identification of PTSD symptoms in patients with MND is essential and allows a more tailored and efficient treatment, with decrease in inappropriate use of physical and chemical restraints.",2020,,Psychogeriatrics,,"(Bruneau M.-A., ma.bruneau@videotron.ca; Pokrzywko K.)

Embase,The complex link between schizophrenia and dementia: Targeting ca2+/camp signalling,"Bergantin, L.B.","Background: Considering a consistent body of evidence has been showing that schizophrenia patients have had an increased risk of developing dementia. The hypothesis that dementia and schizophrenia share a complex link, is emerging. It is highly discussed that dysregulations related to Ca2+ signalling, e.g., an increase of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, could link both diseases, in addition to cAMP signalling pathways. Objective: Thus, revealing this interplay between schizophrenia and dementia may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases. Methods: Publications involving Ca2+ and cAMP signalling pathways, dementia and schizophrenia (alone or combined) were collected by searching PubMed and EMBASE. Results: Both Ca2+ and cAMP signalling pathways (Ca2+/cAMP signalling) control the release of neurotransmitters/hormones and neuronal death, and dysregulations of these cellular processes may be involved in both diseases. Conclusion: Bearing in mind the experience of our group in this field, this article debated the involvement of Ca2+/cAMP signalling in this link between schizophrenia and dementia, including its pharmacological implications.",2020,,Current Pharmaceutical Design,26,27,3326-3331,,10.2174/1381612826666200318144521,,#631,Bergantin 2020

However, some observational studies suggest that these medications might increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether AP medications are associated with the development of VTE or PE, and to assess the risk based on any type of AP drugs, quality of studies and after adjustment of risk factors. Data Sources: To identify relevant studies, we searched PubMed and EMBASE databases up to Febru-ary 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles for related studies. Study Selection: Twenty studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in our meta-analysis after screening relevant observational cohort and case-control studies. Primary Outcome: The primary outcome of our meta-analysis was the occurrence of all VTE or PE only attributed to exposure to AP medications compared with non-exposure to AP medications. Results: Exposure to AP drugs was associated with a significant increase in the risk of VTE (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.30-1.80, I2 = 85%) and PE (RR 3.69, 95% CI 1.23-11.07, I2 = 90%). In the subgroup meta-analysis, the use of low-potency AP drugs was associated with a higher risk of VTE, (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.04-3.47, I2 = 78%). Conclusion: AP exposure was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of VTE and a 3.7-fold increase in the risk of PE. Low-potency AP drugs were associated with a higher risk of VTE.

Design: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting and Participants: People with dementia, confirmed through validated assessment measures. Methods: Major databases were searched until October 21, 2019. Effect sizes [standardized mean difference (SMD)/Hedges g or risk ratio (RR)] were compared separately. Results: Of 3773 search engine hits, 4 meta-analyses were included, representing 31 meta-analyzed trials and 10,054 study participants. Although meta-analyses were generally of adequate high quality, meta-analyzed studies were less so. Nutritional supplements were the only one to show a weight-increasing effect [SMD 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38â€“0.68, ie, medium effect; N = 12, n = 748]. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are associated with an increased risk for weight loss (RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5â€’3.0; N = 9, n = 7010). For the treatment of pain, sensory stimulation has a medium effect (SMD â€“0.58, 95% CI â€“0.99 to âˆ’0.17; N = 6, n = 199), whereas physical activity has a small effect (SMD â€“0.24, 95% CI â€“1.06 to 0.59; N = 2, n = 75). When exploring the characteristics of the psychosocial interventions, group-based interventions demonstrated a medium (SMD â€“0.55, 95% CI â€“1.02 to âˆ’0.09; N = 6, n = 157) and individual psychosocial interventions a small effect (SMD â€“0.27, 95% CI â€“1.06 to 0.53; N = 2, n = 55). Conclusions and Implications: Despite frequent physical comorbidities, the current evidence for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions in people with dementia to prevent and treat these conditions is still in its infancy, and larger trials targeting a wide range of physical health outcomes are urgently needed. Based on the SMDs and RRs, nutritional supplements can be recommended as an intervention to treat malnutrition.

DG is utilized as a major starting material for the production of steroidal drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. Due to its wide range of pharmacological activities and medicinal properties, it has been used in the treatment of cancers, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and infections. Numerous studies have reported that DG is useful in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. Its therapeutic mechanisms are based on the mediation of different signaling pathways, and targeting these pathways might lead to the development of effective therapeutic agents for neurological diseases. The present review mainly summarizes recent progress using DG and its derivatives as therapeutic agents for multiple neurological disorders along with their various mechanisms in the central nervous system. In particular, those related to therapeutic efficacy for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, brain injury, neuroinflammation, and ischemia are discussed. This review article also critically evaluates existing limitations associated with the solubility and bioavailability of DG and discusses imperatives for translational clinical research. It briefly recapitulates recent advances in structural modification and novel formulations to increase the therapeutic efficacy and brain levels of DG. In the present review, databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were used for studies of DG and its derivatives in the treatment of central nervous system diseases published in English until December 10, 2019. Three independent researchers examined articles for eligibility. A total of 150 articles were screened from the above scientific literature databases.

Embase,Pharmacological treatment of hyperactive delirium in people with COVID-19: rethinking conventional approaches,"Ostuzzi, G.; Gastaldon, C.; Papola, D.; Fagiolini, A.; Dursun, S.; Taylor, D.; Correll, C.U.; Barbui, C.","People with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might have several risk factors for delirium, which could in turn notably worsen the prognosis. Although pharmacological approaches for delirium are debated, haloperidol and other first-generation antipsychotics are frequently employed, particularly for hyperactive presentations. However, the use of these conventional treatments could be limited in people with COVID-19, due to the underlying medical condition and the risk of drugâ€“drug interactions with anti-COVID treatments. On these premises, we carried out a rapid review in order to identify possible alternative medications for this particular population. By searching PubMed and the Cochrane Library, we selected the most updated systematic reviews of randomised trials on the pharmacological treatment of delirium in both intensive and non-intensive care settings, and on the treatment of agitation related to acute psychosis or dementia. We identified medications performing significantly better than placebo or haloperidol as the reference treatment in each population considered, and assessed the strength of association according to validated criteria. In addition, we collected data on other relevant clinical elements (i.e. common adverse events, drug-drug interactions with COVID-19 medications, daily doses) and regulatory elements (i.e. therapeutic indications, contra-indications, available formulations). A total of 10 systematic reviews were included. Overall, relatively few medications showed benefits over placebo in the four selected populations. As compared with placebo, significant benefits emerged for quetiapine and dexmedetomidine in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, and for none of the medications in non-ICU settings. Considering also data from indirect populations (agitation related to acute psychosis or dementia), aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone showed a potential benefit in two or three different populations. Despite limitations related to the rapid review methodology and the use of data from indirect populations, the evidence retrieved can pragmatically support treatment choices of frontline practitioners involved in the COVID-19 outbreak, and indicate future research directions for the treatment of delirium in particularly vulnerable populations.",2020,,Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology,10,"(Ostuzzi G., giovanni.ostuzzi@univr.it) Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health and Service Evaluation, University of Verona, Piazzale L.A.

Embase,Nutrition to Prevent or Treat Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: A GRADE Recommendation,"Buckinx, F.; Aubertin-Leheudre, M.","Aging is associated with cognitive declines leading to mild cognitive impairments or Alzheimer disease. Nutrition appear to protect from aging. Some dietary factors could either increase or protect against cognitive declines. This article aimed to provide GRADE recommendations related to nutrition aspects able to prevent or to treat cognitive impairments. A comprehensive literature review was performed using Medline database. The GRADE approach was used to classify quality of the existing evidence (systematic review or meta-analysis). The GRADE process led us to formulate seven key nutritional recommendations to manage cognitive declines, but did not allow us to do it for protein, vitamin B or antioxidants. Thus, 1) adherence to a Mediterranean diet (GRADE 1B); 2) high-level of consumption of mono- or poly- unsaturated fatty acids combined to a low consumption of saturated fatty acids (GRADE 1B); 3) high consumption of fruits and vegetables (GRADE 1B); 4) higher vitamin D intake (GRADE 1C) than the recommended daily allowance. In addition, a ketogenic diet, a low consumption of whole-fat dairy products or a caloric restriction are promising nutritional habits although the evidence does not yet support widespread uptake (GRADE 2C).

However, the existing studies showed controversial results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between ADT and the risk of dementia through a meta-analysis. Methods: Original articles published up to March 2020 were retrieved from Embase, Pubmed, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science for studies focusing on associations between ADT for prostate cancer (PCa) and incidence of dementia. A meta-analysis was conducted using a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect measures. Heterogeneity between the studies was examined using I2 statistics. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regression were conducted, and publication bias was assessed by Eggerâ€™s test. Results: Thirteen studies were included in this systematic review. Eleven cohort studies involving 339,400 cases and 436,851 controls were included in the main meta-analysis. ADT administration was associated with a 21% increase in dementia risk (pooled HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.13â€“1.30, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses based on ADT types showed that luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (HR = 1.14, P < 0.001), bilateral orchiectomy (HR = 1.42, P < 0.001), oral antiandrogens (HR = 1.35, P = 0.138), and combined androgen blockade (HR = 1.22, P = 0.097) were positively related to subsequent risk of dementia, although the differences were not statistically significant with oral antiandrogens and combined androgen blockade.

Methods and results: During March 2018, an electronic search of databases including CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO was conducted. All randomised controlled trials, which examined an intervention strategy to help heart failure patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia cope with self-care, were included. An initial search yielded 1622 citations, six studies were included (N= 595 participants, mean age 68 years). There were no significant improvements in cognitive function and depression. However, significant improvements were seen in memory (p=0.015), working memory (p=0.029) and instrumental activities of daily living (p=0.006). Nurse led interventions improved the patientâ€™s heart failure knowledge (p=0.001), self-care (p<0.05) and quality of life (p=0.029). Key elements of these interventions include brain exercises, for example, syllable stacks, individualised assessment and customised education, personalised self-care schedule development, interactive problem-solving training on scenarios and association techniques to prompt self-care activities.

Embase,Susac's syndrome: An update,"Sauma, J.; Rivera, D.; Wu, A.; Donate-Lopez, J.; Gallego-Pinazo, R.; Chilov, M.; Wu, M.; Wu, L.","Susac's syndrome (SS) is a relatively rare cause of multiple recurrent branch retinal arterial occlusions (BRAO). SS is frequently misdiagnosed and probably underdiagnosed. Ophthalmic manifestations may be the sole presenting sign of SS. Comprehensive literature review The typical triad of encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss and multiple recurrent BRAO is seldom seen at presentation in SS. The characteristic ophthalmological feature in SS is the presence of recurrent multiple BRAO in the absence of intraocular inflammation. Yellow to yellow-white, non-refractile or refractile retinal arterial wall plaques (Gass plaques) found at midarteriolar segments not associated to bifurcations are commonly found in SS. Because of its ability to capture more peripheral retinal area, ultrawide field fluorescein angiography (FA) has definite advantages over conventional FA and its use should be encouraged in patients suspected of having SS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), particularly spectral domain OCT complements FA. Patients with BRAO and hearing loss that do not develop encephalopathy during the initial 2 years will most likely not develop encephalopathy. However, these patients will be prone to recurrent BRAO and hearing loss. Imunosuppression is the cornerstone of treatment but the best regimen still needs to be defined.

The increasing healthcare costs of DM can be prevented in the developing world by improved public healthcare interventions. Modifiable risk factors of DM like sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and stressful conditions are associated with its progression; however, the epidemiological data collected by Public Institutions are limited. Summary: A review of published literature describing geographic distribution of DM and associated dementia in South Asian region, particularly India, was conducted with the purpose of assessing the feasibility and challenges associated with the Yoga-based risk reduction. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for DM and dementia-related articles by using a combination of keywords: Diabetes, Diabetes related Dementia Southeast Asia, Pre-diabetes, Yoga, lifestyle modification, Dementia and Exercise.

Embase,Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Literature Review,"Martin, E.; Velayudhan, L.","Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia have received much attention due to their high prevalence and their significant implications. NPS in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical concept proposed as an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia, is now gradually gaining in interest. We aimed to conduct a selective review to examine the prevalence rate of NPS in MCI and associations of NPS symptoms with disease progression. Summary: We searched the PubMed database for articles on NPS in MCI and included articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. NPS was present in 35-85% of MCI patients. The most common symptoms were depression, irritability, apathy, anxiety, agitation, and sleep problems. Although the associated risk for disease progression of some symptoms, such as apathy and anxiety, was more consistent across studies, evidence was conflicting for symptoms like depression and sleep problems. NPS tend to co-occur, and certain combinations of NPS had a mutual or cumulative effect on disease progression. Late-onset NPS, even in a mild form (mild behavioural impairment) were found to be associated with an increased risk of dementia, even in the absence of cognitive impairment. Key Messages: NPS are highly prevalent in MCI patients and associated with subsequent cognitive deterioration. Late-onset NPS should raise suspicions of neurodegeneration. Future studies with improvised methodology are required to understand the interrelations of NPS and the role they play in the prognosis for patients with MCI.",2020,,Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders,,"(Martin E.; Velayudhan L., latha.velayudhan@kcl.ac.uk) Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom",,,10.1159/000507078,,#609,Martin 2020
Embase,High Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Disease,"Fuchs, F.D.; Whelton, P.K.","Fragmented investigation has masked the overall picture for causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among the risk factors for CVD, high blood pressure (BP) is associated with the strongest evidence for causation and it has a high prevalence of exposure. Biologically, normal levels of BP are considerably lower than what has typically been characterized as normal in research and clinical practice. We propose that CVD is primarily caused by a right-sided shift in the population distribution of BP. Our view that BP is the predominant risk factor for CVD is based on conceptual postulates that have been tested in observational investigations and clinical trials. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that high BP is an important risk factor for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart valve diseases, aortic syndromes, and dementia, in addition to coronary heart disease and stroke. In multivariate modeling, the presumed attributable risk of high BP for stroke and coronary heart disease has increased steadily with progressive use of lower values for normal BP. Meta-analysis of BP-lowering randomized controlled trials has demonstrated a benefit which is almost identical to that predicted from BP risk relationships in cohort studies. Prevention of age-related increases in BP would, in large part, reduce the vascular consequences usually attributed to aging, and together with intensive treatment of established hypertension would eliminate a large proportion of the population burden of BP-related CVD.",2020,,Hypertension,,"(Fuchs F.D.)

Embase,Sildenafil for the treatment of alzheimer's disease: A systematic review,"Sanders, O.","Nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling is compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which degrades cGMP, is upregulated. Sildenafil inhibits PDE5 and increases cGMP levels. Integrating previous findings, we determine that most doses of sildenafil (especially low doses) likely activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î_ coactivator 1Î± (PGC1Î±) via protein kinase G-mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and/or Sirtuin-1 activation and PGC1Î± deacetylation. Via PGC1Î± signaling, low-dose sildenafil likely suppresses Î_-secretase 1 expression and amyloid-Î_ (AÎ_) generation, upregulates antioxidant enzymes, and induces mitochondrial biogenesis. Plus, sildenafil should increase brain perfusion, insulin sensitivity, long-term potentiation, and neurogenesis while suppressing neural apoptosis and inflammation. A systematic review of sildenafil in AD was undertaken. In vitro, sildenafil protected neural mitochondria from AÎ_ and advanced glycation end products. In transgenic AD mice, sildenafil was found to rescue deficits in CREB phosphorylation and memory, upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor, reduce reactive astrocytes and microglia, decrease interleukin-1Î_, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-Î±, decrease neural apoptosis, increase neurogenesis, and reduce tau hyperphosphorylation. All studies that tested AÎ_ levels reported significant improvements except the two that used the highest dosage, consistent with the dose-limiting effect of cGMP-induced phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) activation and cAMP depletion on PGC1Î± signaling. In AD patients, a single dose of sildenafil decreased spontaneous neural activity, increased cerebral blood flow, and increased the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. A randomized control trial of sildenafil (ideally with a PDE2 inhibitor) in AD patients is warranted.",2020,,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease Reports,4,1,91-106,,10.3233/ADR-200166,,#607,Sanders 2020
Embase,Prognosis of Cryptogenic Stroke with Patent Foramen Ovale at Older Ages and Implications for Trials: A Population-Based Study and Systematic Review,"Mazzucco, S.; Li, L.; Rothwell, P.M.","Importance: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure may prevent recurrent stroke after cryptogenic transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke (TIA/stroke) in patients aged 60 years or younger. Patent foramen ovale is associated with cryptogenic stroke in the older population, but risk of recurrence is unknown. Data on prognosis of patients receiving medical treatment at older ages (â‰¥60 years) are essential to justify trials of PFO closure. Objective: To examine the age-specific risk of recurrence in patients with cryptogenic TIA/stroke with PFO. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective study was nested in the population-based Oxford Vascular Study between September 1, 2014, and March 31, 2019, with face-to-face follow-up for 5 years. A total of 416 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of cryptogenic TIA or nondisabling stroke, screened for PFO at a rapid-access TIA/stroke clinic, were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies reporting on ischemic stroke recurrence after cryptogenic TIA/stroke in patients with PFO who were receiving medical therapy alone, or with PFO vs no-PFO was conducted. Sample size calculation for future trials on PFO closure was performed for patients aged 60 years or older. Exposures: Patent foramen ovale and age as modifiers of risk of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic TIA/stroke in patients receiving only medical therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of ischemic stroke recurrence in patients with cryptogenic TIA/stroke and PFO receiving medical therapy only, and in patients with vs without PFO, stratified by age (<65 vs â‰¥65 years), as well as sample-size calculation for future trials of PFO closure in patients aged 60 years or older. Results: Among the 153 Oxford Vascular Study patients with PFO (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [13.7] years; 80 [52.3%] men), recurrent ischemic stroke risk (2.05 per 100 patient-years) was similar to the pooled estimate from a systematic review of 23 other studies (9 trials and 14 observational studies) (2.00 per 100 patient-years; 95% CI, 1.55-2.58). However, there was heterogeneity between studies (P <.001 for heterogeneity), owing mainly to risk increasing with mean cohort age (meta-regression: R2= 0.31; P =.003). In the pooled analysis of 4 studies including patients with or without PFO, increased risk of stroke recurrence with PFO was seen only at age 65 years or older (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2; P =.001 for difference; P =.39 for heterogeneity). The pooled ischemic stroke risk was 3.27 per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 2.59-4.13) in 4 cohorts with mean age 60 years or older. Assuming the more conservative 2.0 per 100 patient-years ischemic stroke risk in the PFO nonclosure arms of future trials in patients aged 60 years or older, projected sample sizes were 1080 per arm for 80% power to detect a 33% relative risk reduction. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that age is a determinant of risk of ischemic stroke after cryptogenic TIA/stroke in patients with PFO, such that trials of PFO closure at older ages are justified; however, projected sample sizes are large..",2020,,JAMA Neurology,,"(Mazzucco S., sara.mazzucco@ndcn.ox.ac.uk; Li L.; Rothwell P.M.)

The relationship between plasma lipids and cognitive function is complex and controversial. Due to the increasing life expectancy of the population, there is an urgent need to control vascular risk factors and to identify therapies to prevent and treat both cognitive impairment and dementia. Here, we reviewed the effects of plasma lipids and statins on cognitive function. Data Sources: We searched the PubMed database for research articles published through November 2017 with key words including 'plasma lipids,' 'hyperlipidemia,' 'hypercholesterolemia,' 'statins,' and 'cognition function.' Study Selection: Articles were retrieved and reviewed to analyze the effects of plasma lipids and statins on cognitive function and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Results: Many studies have examined the relationship between plasma lipids and cognitive function, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn. The mechanisms involved may include blood-brain barrier injury, the influence on small blood vessels in the brain, the influence on amyloid deposition, and a neuroprotective effect. To date, most studies of statins and cognition have been observational, with few randomized controlled trials. Therefore, firm conclusions regarding whether mid- or long-term statin use affects cognition function and dementia remain elusive. However, increasing concern exists that statins may be a causative factor for cognitive problems. These adverse effects appear to be rare and likely represent a yet-to-be-defined vulnerability in susceptible individuals. Conclusions: The association between plasma lipids and cognition, the mechanism of the influence of plasma lipids on cognitive function, and the association between statins and cognitive function are complex issues and currently not fully understood. Future research aimed at identifying the mechanisms that underlie the effects of plasma lipids and statins on cognition will not only provide important insight into the causes and interdependencies of cognitive impairment and dementia, but also inspire novel strategies for treating and preventing these cognitive disorders.",2018,,Chinese Medical Journal,131,4,471-476,,10.4103/0366-6999.225062,,#414,Li 2018

Besides this alarming fact, it is noted too that almost three-quarter of people with AD reside in low or middle- income nations. In recent years, cognitive and behavioral neuroscientists have focused on a possible correlation between environmental agents and genetic risk factors for these dementias. Methods: In this narrative review, a close review of Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System was conducted. The authors aimed at analyzing possible interactions between lifestyle patterns and major risk factors responsible for cognitive decline and dementia, considering that the prevention or treatment of midlife modifiable risks may possibly reduce population-wide late-life pathological neurodegeneration. Results: This review focuses on modifiable risk factors for late-life cognitive decline. A growing number of studies have indicated that the impact of genetics and epigenetic factors on dementia risk is dependent on different lifestyle factors, ranging from leisure activities and nutritional habits, through to social interaction and toxic exposure. Conclusion: Despite all evidence regarding modifiable risk factors possibly reducing the risk of developing dementia in later life, many unanswered questions remain regarding the direct influence of these variables in later life.

With the worldâ€™s fastest aging population, it is estimated that one in five elderly people will be living with dementia in Japan by 2025. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), accounting for around two-thirds of dementia cases. A systematic review was conducted to examine the epidemiology and associated burden of AD in Japan and to identify how AD is diagnosed and managed in Japan. English and Japanese language databases were searched for articles published between January 2000 and November 2015. Relevant Japanese sources, clinical practice guideline registers, and reference lists were also searched. Systematic reviews and cohort and case-control studies were eligible for inclusion, with a total of 60 studies included. The most recent national survey conducted in six regions of Japan reported the mean prevalence of dementia in people aged =65 years to be 15.75% (95% CI: 12.4, 22.2%), which is much higher than the previous estimated rate of 10% in 2010. AD was confirmed as the predominant type of dementia, accounting for 65.8% of all cases. Advancing age and low education were the most consistently reported risk factors for AD dementia. Japanese guidelines for the management of dementia were released in 2010 providing specific guidance for AD about clinical signs, image findings, biochemical markers, and treatment approaches. Pharmacotherapies and non-pharmacotherapies to relieve cognitive symptoms were introduced, as were recommendations to achieve better patient care.

Embase,Role of cathepsins in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review,"Rastegar, S.; Nouri, A.; Masoudi, R.; Tavakoli, R.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease. In addition to the precipitating of two proteins beta-amyloid peptide and neurofebrillary tangles, which are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD, other factors such as inflammatory mechanisms and changes in lysosomal enzymes play an important part in the pathogenesis of this disease. Increased and decreased lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsin, can lead to functional impairment and gradual death of neurons. The aim of this review was to investigate the role of cathepsins in the pathogenesis of AD. To conduct this review, relevant articles published between 2000 and 2016, and indexed in reliable databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science were retrieved. After reviewing the articles, 30 articles that directly addressed the subject of this re-view were included in final analysis. Cathepsins exacerbate intracellular conditions in neurons, by processing beta-amyloid precursor protein and converting it into amyloid beta. They also play a protective role against AD and fight it by catalyzing the decomposition of beta-amyloids and converting them into the cut out forms of the carboxyl C-terminus. In addition, the 24 kDa fragment resulting from the effect of cathepsin D on apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the second binding to the receptor in the ApoE. This fragment may also be the cause of the pathogenicity of Apo E in AD. Identifying and explaining the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD can play a significant role in the prevention and treatment of this disease. Since cathep-sins play a pivotal role in the decomposition of beta-amyloid and reduction of the risk of AD, further stud-ies can be considered an effective approach to study AD.",2018,,Journal of Medical and Biomedical Sciences,7,1,10-Jan,,10.4314/jmbs.v7i1.1,,#398,Rastegar 2018
Embase,Is fish oil a potential treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy?,"Yorek, M.A.","Background: Peripheral neuropathy affects about 50% of the diabetic population. The manifestations range from pain, numbness, paresthesia and ulceration in the extremities and it is the major cause of non-traumatic amputations. Currently there is no effective treatment for peripheral neuropathy. With the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes and associated complications reaching epidemic levels, there is a critical need for finding a treatment to preserve nerve function. Introduction: This article will review the potential for fish oil as a treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Methods: A through search of the PubMed database was performed and relevant articles on the topic were included in this review. Results: Many studies support a role for fish oil in cardiovascular health. However, less information is available regarding the effect of fish oil on diabetes complications including neuropathy. Pre-clinical studies from my laboratory using diabetic rodent models have demonstrated that fish oil can slow progression and reverse diabetic neuropathy as determined by examining multiple endpoints. Mechanistically fish oil has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Lowering the omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio has been shown to be anti-thrombotic. Moreover, metabolites of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, the main polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oil, commonly referred to as resolvins and neuroprotectin have been shown to be neuroprotective and can stimulate neuron outgrowth in vitro. Conclusion: Additional studies are required but existing data suggests that dietary enrichment with omega-3 fatty acids contained in fish oil may be beneficial treatment for diabetic neuropathy.",2018,,Current Diabetes Reviews,14,4,339-349,,10.2174/1573399813666170522155327,,#396,Yorek 2018
Embase,Dietary fat intake and risk of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and dementia: A meta-analysis of cohort studies,"Ruan, Y.; Tang, J.; Guo, X.; Li, K.; Li, D.","Background: Epidemiological studies showed that dietary fat intake is associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and dementia risk, however, the association remain inconsistent. This metaanalysis aimed to systematically examine the association of dietary fat intake with AD and dementia risk. Methods: We have systematically searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library up to May 1st 2017. Prospective cohort studies were included if they reported on the association of dietary fat intake with AD and dementia risk. Multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for the highest versus lowest category were pooled by using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 8630 participants and 633 cases from four independent prospective cohort studies were included in the present meta-analysis. A higher dietary saturated fat intake was significantly associated with an increased risk of 39% and 105% for AD (RR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.94) and dementia (RR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.06, 3.98), respectively. Dose-response analysis indicated a 4 g/day increment of saturated fat intake was related to 15% higher risk of AD (RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.31). However, there was no significant association found between dietary intake of total, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fat and AD or dementia risk. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides significant evidence of positive association between higher saturated fat intake and AD and dementia risk.",2018,,Current Alzheimer Research,15,9,869-876,,10.2174/1567205015666180427142350,,#395,Ruan 2018
Embase,"The association of statin use with risk of kidney, bladder and prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies","Chen, J.; Zhang, B.; Chen, D.; Zhuang, W.","Background: Emerging evidence suggested that statins might decrease the risk of cancer. This study examined the associations of statin use with the risk of main urologic cancer, and a sex-specific relationship between statin use and the risk of cancer was also evaluated. Methods: A literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases was undertaken through February 2017 evaluating the association between statin use and risk of main urologic cancer. Pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects model. In addition, we also estimated RR ratios (RRRs) between men and women. Results: A total of 30 cohort studies contributed to the analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that statin users did not experience a significantly decreased risk for developing kidney cancer in both women and men (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.91-1.11). Statin use in women had the reduced tendency for the risk of kidney cancer, but statin use in men had an adverse tendency for the risk of this disease (Women: RR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.85-1.12; Men: RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.99-1.19). The pooled multiple-adjusted women-to-men RRR for incident kidney cancer was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.75-1.05). Compared to non-users, statin users yielded the reduced risk of total, advanced, high-grade, and low-grade prostate cancer by approximately 12%, 18%, 14% and 7% (Total: RR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.93; Advanced: RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.70-0.95; High-grade: RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.68-0.99; Low-grade: RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.86-0.99), whereas the significant effects were not observed for bladder cancer (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.88-1.17). Conclusions: The results found that sex difference could affect the association of statin use with the risk of kidney cancer. The statin use could reduce the risk of prostate cancer but no associations were found between statin use and bladder cancer.",2018,,International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine,11,9,8873,,,,#392,Chen 2018
Embase,Patient-centered care interventions to reduce the inappropriate prescription and use of benzodiazepines and z-drugs: A systematic review,"Mokhar, A.; Topp, J.; HÃ_rter, M.; Schulz, H.; Kuhn, S.; Verthein, U.; Dirmaier, J.","Background: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and z-drugs are effective drugs, but they are prescribed excessively worldwide. International guidelines recommend a maximum treatment duration of 4 weeks. Although these drugs are effective in the short-term, long-term BZD therapy is associated with considerable adverse effects, the development of tolerance and, finally, addiction. However, there are different interventions in terms of patient-centered care that aim to reduce the use of BZDs and z-drugs as well as assist health care professionals (HCPs) in preventing the inappropriate prescription of BZDs. Aim: The aim of this systematic review was to identify interventions that promote patient-centered treatments for inappropriate BZD and z-drug use and to analyze their effectiveness in reducing the inappropriate use of these drugs. Methods: To identify relevant studies, the PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Psyndex, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Studies with controlled designs focusing on adult patients were included. Trials with chronically or mentally ill patients were excluded if long-term BZD and z-drug use was indicated. Study extraction was performed based on the Cochrane Form for study extraction. To assess the quality of the studies, we used a tool based on the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials. Results: We identified 7, 068 studies and selected 20 for systematic review. Nine interventions focused on patients, nine on HCPs, and two on both patients and HCPs. Intervention types ranged from simple to multifaceted. Patient-centered interventions that provided patient information effectively increased the appropriate use of BZDs. The educational approaches for HCPs that aimed to achieve appropriate prescription reported inconsistent results. The methods that combined informing patients and HCPs led to a significant reduction in BZD use. Conclusions: This is the first review of studies focused on patient-centered approaches to reducing the inappropriate prescription and use of BZDs and z-drugs. The patient-centered dimension of patient information was responsible for a decrease in BZD and z-drug consumption. Further, in some studies, the patient-centered dimensions responsible for reducing the prescription and use of BZDs and z-drugs were the clinician's essential characteristics and clinician-patient communication.",2018,,PeerJ,2018,10,,,10.7717/peerj.5535,,#391,Mokhar 2018

Objective: To undertake a systematic review to critically appraise and provide an evidence-based summary of the magnitude and direction of the global changes in dementia prevalence and incidence across time. Methods: Medline, EMBASE, and PsychINFO were searched for studies focused on secular trends in dementia prevalence and/or incidence until 18 December 2017. In total, 10,992 articles were identified and 43 retained. Results: Overall, prevalence rates are largely increasing (evidence primarily from record-based surveys and cohort studies in Japan, Canada, and France) or have remained stable (evidence primarily from cohort studies in Sweden, Spain and China). A significant decline in prevalence has however been reported in more recent studies (i.e., from 2010 onwards) from Europe (e.g., UK and Sweden) and the USA. Incidence rates have generally remained stable or decreased in China, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, UK, and USA. An increase has only been reported in five countries: Italy, Japan, Wales, Germany, and the Netherlands. Only one study reported findings (stability in incidence) from a low and middle-income country using data from Nigeria. Conclusions: The evidence on secular trends in the prevalence and incidence of dementia is mixed including contradictory findings using different (and in some cases the same) datasets in some countries (e.g., the USA, UK, and Sweden). This making it difficult to draw concrete conclusions. However, declining trends recently observed in some high-income Western countries in the most recent two decades including the UK, USA, and Sweden are encouraging.

There is some evidence for a reduction of brain omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease. n-3 PUFAs exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic properties as well as being able to reduce tau phosphorylation. Many observational studies have demonstrated a link between n-3 PUFAs and cognitive aging, and some, but not all, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a benefit of n-3 PUFA supplementation on cognition, particularly in those subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The identification of a biomarker that reflects n-3 PUFA intake over time and consequent tissue levels is required. In this narrative review we discuss the evidence associating red blood cell membrane n-3 PUFAs with cognitive function and structural brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Embase,Early life stress and epigenetics in late-onset Alzheimerâ€™s dementia: A systematic review,"Lemche, E.","Involvement of life stress in Late-Onset Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (LOAD) has been evinced in longitudinal cohort epidemiological studies, and endocrinologic evidence suggests involvements of catecholamine and corticosteroid systems in LOAD. Early Life Stress (ELS) rodent models have successfully demonstrated sequelae of maternal separation resulting in LOAD-analogous pathology, thereby supporting a role of insulin receptor signalling pertaining to GSK-3beta facilitated tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloidogenic processing. Discussed are relevant ELS studies, and findings from three mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (JNK/SAPK pathway, ERK pathway, p38/MAPK pathway) relevant for mediating environmental stresses. Further considered were the roles of autophagy impairment, neuroinflammation, and brain insulin resistance. For the meta-analytic evaluation, 224 candidate gene loci were extracted from reviews of animal studies of LOAD pathophysiological mechanisms, of which 60 had no positive results in human LOAD association studies. These loci were combined with 89 gene loci confirmed as LOAD risk genes in previous GWAS and WES. Of the 313 risk gene loci evaluated, there were 35 human reports on epigenomic modifications in terms of methylation or histone acetylation. 64 microRNA gene regulation mechanisms were published for the compiled loci. Genomic association studies support close relations of both noradrenergic and glucocorticoid systems with LOAD. For HPA involvement, a CRHR1 haplotype with MAPT was described, but further association of only HSD11B1 with LOAD found; however, association of FKBP1 and NC3R1 polymorphisms was documented in support of stress influence to LOAD. In the brain insulin system, IGF2R, INSR, INSRR, and plasticity regulator ARC, were associated with LOAD. Pertaining to compromised myelin stability in LOAD, relevant associations were found for BIN1, RELN, SORL1, SORCS1, CNP, MAG, and MOG. Regarding epigenetic modifications, both methylation variability and de-acetylation were reported for LOAD. The majority of up-to-date epigenomic findings include reported modifications in the well-known LOAD core pathology loci MAPT, BACE1, APP (with FOS, EGR1), PSEN1, PSEN2, and highlight a central role of BDNF. Pertaining to ELS, relevant loci are FKBP5, EGR1, GSK3B; critical roles of inflammation are indicated by CRP, TNFA, NFKB1 modifications; for cholesterol biosynthesis, DHCR24; for myelin stability BIN1, SORL1, CNP; pertaining to (epi)genetic mechanisms, hTERT, MBD2, DNMT1, MTHFR2. Findings on gene regulation were accumulated for BACE1, MAPK signalling, TLR4, BDNF, insulin signalling, with most reports for miR-132 and miR-27. Unclear in epigenomic studies remains the role of noradrenergic signalling, previously demonstrated by neuropathological findings of childhood nucleus caeruleus degeneration for LOAD tauopathy.",2018,,Current Genomics,19,7,522-602,,10.2174/1389202919666171229145156,,#386,Lemche 2018
Embase,"A systematic review of the psychological implications of genetic testing: A comparative analysis among cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and cancer diseases","Oliveri, S.; Ferrari, F.; Manfrinati, A.; Pravettoni, G.","Background: Genetic testing is performed for different purposes, such as identifying carriers, predicting a disease onset in presymptomatic individuals or confirming a diagnosis. However, these tests may have notable psychological effects, such as generating anxiety and depression. These effects may depend on peopleâ€™s perception of risk, severity, and controllability of the disease; and the availability of treatments. To date, there are no reports that analyze these factors specifically, and their role in influencing genetic test usersâ€™ experience. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the psychological implication of undergoing genetic testing for cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and cancer diseases. Articles were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar, and PsychInfo. Results: 47 studies were included, 9 concerning cardiovascular disease, 18 neurodegenerative disorders, and 20 for cancer disease. According to the reviewed studies, people experience no significant increase in distress and anxiety, or adverse impacts on quality of life, except the Huntington disease, which is characterized by depressive symptoms, suicidal ideations, and hopelessness in gene carriers. People tend to consider genetic tests as valid information to take important preventive decisions. Genetic risk for cardiovascular disease is perceived to be manageable; genetic analysis for some neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer) or cancer (breast cancer in particular) is considered useful because the problem could be addressed in advance with preventive behaviors. Conclusions: Genetic tests should be proposed along with proper psychological support and counseling focused on usersâ€™ genetic health literacy; perception of risk, beliefs about disease controllability, in order to foster fruitful medical decisions.",2018,,Frontiers in Genetics,9,"(Oliveri S., serena.oliveri@unimi.it; Pravettoni G.)

Embase,Tools for testing decision-making capacity in dementia,"Pennington, C.; Davey, K.; Meulen, R.T.; Coulthard, E.; Kehoe, P.G.","Background: dementia is a common cause of altered decision-making capacity. Determining whether an individual has the ability to make a specific decision can be very challenging for both clinicians and researchers. The UK legislation requires that we both promote residual capacity where possible, and protect vulnerable adults who cannot make independent decisions. We evaluated published instruments designed to aid in the assessment of capacity, focussing on those meeting the UK legal requirements. We also consider further disease and culture-specific factors which may influence decision making. Methods: a search of electronic databases was made for articles published between 2000 and 2017 detailing structured tools for the assessment of mental capacity. These were evaluated against the UK legal requirements. Results: nine tools were identified which fulfilled the UK legal requirements. Their design and structure varied, as did the level of reliability and validity data available. Some instruments can be tailored for a specific decisional scenario, whilst others are designed for use by particular patient groups. Discussion: a wide range of mental capacity assessment instruments is available, but not all fulfil the UK legal requirements. Healthcare professionals and researchers should be mindful of personal, cultural and disease-specific factors when assessing capacity. No gold standard for capacity assessment exists, which hampers the evaluation of different approaches. A combination of the opinion of a healthcare professional or researcher trained in capacity evaluation, plus the use of a structured assessment tool is the most robust approach.",2018,,Age and Ageing,47,6,778-784,,10.1093/ageing/afy096,,#384,Pennington 2018
Embase,Meta-Analysis of the relationship between the APOE gene and the onset of Parkinsonâ€™s disease dementia,"Pang, S.; Li, J.; Zhang, Y.; Chen, J.","Purpose. To clarify the relationship between certain genotypes or alleles of the APOE gene and the onset risk of Parkinsonâ€™s disease dementia (PDD). Methods. The PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched to identify all case-control studies and cohort studies published before October 30, 2017, that investigated the association between the APOE gene and the onset of PDD. Manual information retrieval was also performed. All studies that met the quality requirements were included in a meta-analysis performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results. The meta-analysis included 17 studies, with a total of 820 patients in the PDD group and 1,922 in the non-PDD group. The influence of the APOE gene on PDD onset was analyzed from three aspects: five genotypes vs. Îµ3/3, Îµ2+/Îµ4+ vs. Îµ3/3, and Îµ4+ vs. Îµ4âˆ’. The risk factors for PDD may include the genotypes Îµ3/4 (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14â€“1.89) and Îµ4/4 (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.20â€“7.14). In patients with PDD, there was no significant difference in the distribution of Îµ2+ vs. Îµ3/3 (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.97â€“1.87, P 0.07). The risk of PDD was 1.61 times greater in Îµ4+ compared with Îµ3/3 (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.24â€“2.08, P 0.0003). As the results indicated that Îµ2+ did not play a role as a risk factor or a protective factor, we divided the population into Îµ4+ and Îµ4 for the meta-analysis and found that, among patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, the dementia risk of those with Îµ4+ was 1.72 times greater than that of those with Îµ4 (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.41â€“2.10, P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis in accordance with different geographical regions revealed that Îµ4+ was a risk factor for PDD in people from all regions. Conclusions. Among the APOE genotypes, Îµ2+ is neither a risk factor nor a protective factor for PDD, while Îµ4+ is a risk factor for PDD. The present results are applicable to Asian, European, and American patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Regarding the single APOE genotypes, Îµ3/4 and Îµ4/4 may be risk factors for PDD; however, further studies with large sample sizes are needed to verify this.",2018,,Parkinson's Disease,2018,"(Pang S.; Li J.; Zhang Y.; Chen J., cjj@jlu.edu.cn) Department of Neurology, Chinaâ€“Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, No. 126, Xian Tai Road, Changchun, Jilin, China",,,10.1155/2018/9497147,,#383,Pang 2018

Previous cohort studies have had insufficient follow-up to assess the time course of risks, have not stratified risks by antithrombotic use, and have not reported extracranial bleeds or functional outcome of ICH versus ischemic stroke. Methods-In 2 independent prospective cohorts with transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke (Oxford Vascular Study/ mainly white; University of Hong Kong/mainly Chinese), antiplatelet treatment was started routinely irrespective of microbleed burden. Risks, time course and outcome of ICH, extracranial bleeds, and recurrent ischemic events were determined and stratified by microbleed burden (0 versus 1, 2-4, and â‰¥5), adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Results-Microbleeds were more frequent in the Chinese cohort (450 of 1003 versus 165 of 1080; P<0.0001), but risk associations were similar during 7433 patient-years of follow-up. Among 1811 patients on antiplatelet drugs, risk of major extracranial bleeds was unrelated to microbleed burden (Ptrend=0.87), but the 5-year risk of ICH was steeply related (Ptrend<0.0001), with 11 of 15 (73%) of ICH in 140 of 1811 (7.7%) patients with â‰¥5 microbleeds. However, risk of ischemic stroke also increased with microbleed burden (Ptrend=0.013), such that risk of ischemic stroke and coronary events exceeded ICH and major extracranial bleeds during the first year, even among patients with â‰¥5 microbleeds (11.6% versus 3.9%). However, this ratio changed over time, with risk of hemorrhage (11.2%) matching that of ischemic events (12.0%) after 1 year. Moreover, whereas the association between microbleed burden and risk of ischemic stroke was due mainly to nondisabling events (Ptrend=0.007), the association with ICH was accounted for (Ptrend<0.0001) by disabling/fatal events (â‰¥5 microbleeds: 82% disabling/fatal ICH versus 40% disabling/fatal ischemic stroke; P=0.035). Conclusions-In white and Chinese patients with â‰¥5 microbleeds, withholding antiplatelet drugs during the first year after transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke may be inappropriate. However, the risk of ICH may outweigh any benefit thereafter.",2018,,Stroke,49,6,1434-1442,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.020104,,#382,Lau 2018

Therefore, we performed a systematic review to determine the risk of motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) or driving impairment caused by dementia, in order to update international guidelines on driving with dementia. Seven literature databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, etc.) were searched for all research studies published after 2004 containing participants with mild, moderate, or severe dementia. From the retrieved 12,860 search results, we included nine studies in this analysis, involving 378 participants with dementia and 416 healthy controls. Two studies reported on self-/informant-reported MVC risk, one revealing a four-fold increase in MVCs per 1,000 miles driven per week in 3 years prior, and the other showing no statistically significant increase over the same time span. We found medium to large effects of dementia on driving abilities in six of the seven recent studies that examined driving impairment.

Embase,Alzheimer's disease: A challenge in its management with certain medicinal plants - a review,"Pratap, G.K.; Ashwini, S.; Shantaram, M.","It is well known that some plants have medicinal properties and their knowledge has been accumulated in the course of many centuries, based on different medicinal systems such as Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. In India, it is reported that traditional healers use nearly 2,500 plant species and 100 plant species serve as regular sources of medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Alzheimer's disease is globally recognized as the most common form of dementia and it disrupts critical metabolic processes which keep neurons healthy. These disruptions cause nerve cells in the brain to stop working, lose connections with other nerve cells and finally die. The destruction and death of nerve cell causes the memory failure, personality changes and problems in carrying out daily activities. The Alzheimer's disease has an abundance of two abnormal structures- amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle. The Alzheimer's disease is caused by a mixture of genetic, environmental, and life style factors. The current review methodically summarizes the Alzheimer's disease and the effects of phyto-chemicals of medicinal plants in various models of Alzheimer's disease.",2017,,International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research,8,12,4960-4972,,10.13040/IJPSR.0975-8232.8(12).4960-72,,#377,Pratap 2017

Studies from the last several years have shown that people with diabetes have an increased risk for dementia and cognitive impairment. Therefore, the authors of this consensus review tried to elaborate on the role of diabetes, especially diabetes type 2 (T2DM) in both AD and VaD. Based on the clinical and experimental work of scientists from 18 countries participating in the International Congress on Vascular Disorders and on literature search using PUBMED, it can be concluded that T2DM is a risk factor for both, AD and VaD, based on a pathology of glucose utilization. This pathology is the consequence of a disturbance of insulin-related mechanisms leading to brain insulin resistance. Although the underlying pathological mechanisms for AD and VaD are different in many aspects, the contribution of T2DM and insulin resistant brain state (IRBS) to cerebrovascular disturbances in both disorders cannot be neglected. Therefore, early diagnosis of metabolic parameters including those relevant for T2DM is required. Moreover, it is possible that therapeutic options utilized today for diabetes treatment may also have an effect on the risk for dementia.

Embase,The management of sleep disorders in dementia: An update,"Kinnunen, K.M.; Vikhanova, A.; Livingston, G.","Purpose of review Sleep disorders in dementia cause distress and may lead to families being unable to care for someone with dementia at home. Recent Cochrane reviews found no interventions of proven effectiveness. There was no effect of light therapy and moderate evidence that melatonin was ineffective both given without knowledge of the patient's circadian rhythm. The current article updates this review by considering newer publications on interventions for sleep disorders or abnormalities of the sleep-wake cycle in people with dementia living in the community. Recent findings We searched electronically for new primary research, reviews and meta-analyses and identified 258 articles published between 15/12/2015 and 14/06/2017 on sleep and dementia; 43 of them on nonpharmacological or pharmacological treatments. Fifteen articles reported on the management of sleep disturbances in people with dementia, living at home. Those using pharmacological treatments (melatonin, psychotropic medications, donepezil, memantine) encompassed a meta-analysis, two double-blind RCTs, two uncontrolled trials, two population-based studies, and one case report. The studies of behavioural interventions comprised five uncontrolled trials, one case series, and one qualitative study. We also included three recent reviews on the management of sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease; pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia, and dementia prevention, intervention and care. None of these found a treatment that showed definitive effectiveness, although there is preliminary work about nonpharmacological interventions, which can be built on. Summary Clinically effective, safe treatment of sleep disturbances in dementia remains an unresolved challenge. Given the importance of sleep and the many consequences of its disruption, well designed controlled trials are needed to determine acceptable and cost-effective treatment strategies that work for sleep disturbances.",2017,,Current Opinion in Psychiatry,30,6,491-497,,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000370,,#374,Kinnunen 2017

Objective: This study aimed to summarise and rate the quality of the evidence of the association between surgery and sCJD. Design and methods: Firstly, we conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of caseâ€“control studies with major surgical procedures as exposures under study. To assess quality of evidence, we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Secondly, we conducted a systematic review of sCJD case reports after sharing neurosurgical instruments. Results: Thirteen caseâ€“control studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review of caseâ€“control studies. sCJD was positively associated with heart surgery, heart and vascular surgery and eye surgery, negatively associated with tonsillectomy and appendectomy, and not associated with neurosurgery or unspecified major surgery. The overall quality of evidence was rated as very low. A single caseâ€“control study with a low risk of bias found a strong association between surgery conducted more than 20 years before disease onset and sCJD. Seven cases were described as potentially transmitted by reused neurosurgical instruments. Conclusion: The association between surgery and sCJD remains uncertain. Measures currently recommended for preventing sCJD transmission should be strongly maintained.

Embase,Efficacy and Tolerability of Phytomedicines in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Review,"Farzaei, M.H.; Shahpiri, Z.; Bahramsoltani, R.; nia, M.M.; Najafi, F.; Rahimi, R.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that can cause cognition, mobility, and sensory impairments. It is considered one of the most common non-traumatic causes of disability in the world. The aim of the present article was to review the clinical evidence related to medicinal plants in the management of MS symptoms. Electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, and Scopus, were searched for entries from 1966 to February 2017. Only clinical studies were included in this review. Different medicinal plants have positive effects on MS, including Andrographis paniculata, Boswellia papyrifera, Ruta graveolens, Vaccinium spp., Camellia sinensis, Panax ginseng, Aloysia citrodora, Ginkgo biloba, Oenothera biennis, and Cannabis sativa. C. sativa had the highest level of clinical evidence, supporting its efficacy in MS symptoms. Proanthocyanidins, ginkgo flavone glycosides, ginsenosides, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, cannabinoids (including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol), boswellic acid, and andrographolide were presented as the main bioactive components of medicinal plants with therapeutic benefits in MS. The main complications of MS in which natural drugs were effective include spasticity, fatigue, scotoma, incontinence, urinary urgency, nocturia, memory performance, functional performance, and tremor. Herbal medicines were mostly well tolerated, and the adverse effects were limited to mild to moderate. Further well-designed human studies with a large sample size and longer follow-up period are recommended to confirm the role of medicinal plants and their metabolites in the management of MS.",2017,,CNS Drugs,31,10,867-889,,10.1007/s40263-017-0466-4,,#370,Farzaei 2017

Here we synthesize the literature on the association of ADT for the treatment of prostate cancer with dementia risk.Methods:We conducted a systematic review of articles reporting the outcome of dementia among individuals with prostate cancer in those exposed to ADT versus a lesser-exposed comparison group (for example, ADT versus no-ADT; continuous versus intermittent ADT) using PubMed (1966-present), Web of Science (1945-present), Embase (1966-present) and PsycINFO (1806-present).

Random- or fixed-effects meta-analytic models were used in the presence or absence of heterogeneity per the I 2 statistic, respectively. Small study effects were evaluated using Egger and Begg's tests.Results:Nine studies were included in the systematic review. Seven studies reported an adjusted effect estimate for dementia risk. A random-effects meta-analysis of studies reporting any dementia outcome, which included 50 541 individuals, showed an increased risk of dementia among ADT users (hazard ratio (HR), 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.00; P=0.02). We separately meta-analyzed studies reporting all-cause dementia (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.05-2.02; P<0.001) and Alzheimer's disease (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.99-1.57; P=0.06). There was no evidence of bias from small study effects (Egger, P=0.19; Begg, P=1.00).Conclusion:The currently available combined evidence suggests that ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer may be associated with an increased dementia risk.

There is limited evidence of what is effective in the reduction and management of FI in care homes. Using realist synthesis, 6 potential program theories of what should work were identified. These addressed clinician-led support, assessment, and review; the contribution of teaching and support for care home staff on how to reduce and manage FI; addressing the causes and prevention of constipation; how cognitive and physical capacity of the resident affects outcomes; how the potential for recovery, reduction, and management of FI is understood by those involved; and how the care of people living with dementia and FI is integral to the work patterns of the care home and its staff. Dementia was a known risk factor for fecal incontinence (FI), but how it affected uptake of different interventions or the dementia specific continence and toileting skills staff require, were not addressed in the literature. There was a lack of dementia-specific evidence on continence aids. Most care home residents with FI will be doubly incontinent; there is, therefore, limited value in focusing solely on FI or single causes, such as constipation. Medical and nursing support for continence care is an important resource, but it is unhelpful to create a distinction between what is continence care and what is personal or intimate care. Prompted toileting is an approach that may be particularly beneficial for some residents. Valuing the intimate and personal care work unqualified and junior staff provide to people living with dementia and reinforcement of good practice in ways that are meaningful to this workforce are important clinician-led activities. Providing dementia-sensitive continence care within the daily work routines of care homes is key to helping to reduce and manage FI for this population.",2017,,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,18,9,752-760.e1,,10.1016/j.jamda.2017.05.025,,#364,Buswell 2017

Before the meeting, the planning committee examined articles published between 2005 and October 2015 and prepared this literature review, which summarized broadly CTE research and addressed questions about the pathophysiological basis of CTE and its relationship to blast-and nonblast-related head injury. It served to inform participants objectively and help focus meeting discussion on identifying knowledge gaps and priority research areas. CTE is described generally as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting persons exposed to head injury. Affected individuals have been participants primarily in contact sports and military personnel, some of whom were exposed to blast. The symptomatology of CTE overlaps with Alzheimer's disease and includes neurological and cognitive deficits, psychiatric and behavioral problems, and dementia. There are no validated diagnostic criteria, and neuropathological evidence of CTE has come exclusively from autopsy examination of subjects with histories of exposure to head injury. The perivascular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-Tau) at the depths of cortical sulci is thought to be unique to CTE and has been proposed as a diagnostic requirement, although the contribution of p-Tau and other reported pathologies to the development of clinical symptoms of CTE are unknown. The literature on CTE is limited and is focused predominantly on head injuries unrelated to blast exposure (e.g., football players and boxers). In addition, comparative analyses of clinical case reports has been challenging because of small case numbers, selection biases, methodological differences, and lack of matched controls, particularly for blast-exposed individuals. Consequently, the existing literature is not sufficient to determine whether the development of CTE is associated with head injury frequency (e.g., single vs. multiple exposures) or head injury type (e.g., impact, nonimpact, blast-related). Moreover, the incidence and prevalence of CTE in at-risk populations is unknown. Future research priorities should include identifying additional risk factors, pursuing population-based longitudinal studies, and developing the ability to detect and diagnose CTE in living persons using validated criteria.",2017,,Journal of Neurotrauma,34,S1,S26-S43,,10.1089/neu.2017.5218,,#363,Aldag 2017

Objective: to assess whether there is an association between performance on motor function tests and incident dementia. Methods: electronic database, grey literature and hand searching identified studies testing for associations between baseline motor function and incident dementia in older adults. Results: of 2,540 potentially relevant documents, 37 met the final inclusion criteria and were reviewed qualitatively. Three meta-analyses were conducted using data from 10 studies. Three main motor domains-upper limb motor function, parkinsonism and lower limb motor function-emerged as associated with increased risk of incident dementia. Studies including older adults without neurological overt disease found a higher risk of incident dementia associated with poorer performance on composite motor function scores, balance and gait velocity (meta-analysis pooled HR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.65). Mixed results were found across different study samples for upper limb motor function, overall parkinsonism (meta-analysis pooled OR = 3.05, 95% CI: 1.31, 7.08), bradykinesia and rigidity. Studies restricted to older adults with Parkinson's Disease found weak or no association with incident dementia even for motor domains highly associated in less restrictive samples. Tremor was not associated with an increased risk of dementia in any population (meta-analysis pooled HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.31, 2.03).

A narrative literature review,"Diehl-Schmid, J.; Jox, R.; Gauthier, S.; Belleville, S.; Racine, E.; SchÃ_le, C.; Turecki, G.; Richard-Devantoy, S.","Background: Evidence-based data on prevalence and risk factors of suicidal intentions and behavior in dementia are as scarce as the data on assisted dying. The present literature review aimed on summarizing the current knowledge and provides a critical discussion of the results. Methods: A systematic narrative literature review was performed using Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PSYNDEX, PSYCINFO, Sowiport, and Social Sciences Citation Index literature. Results: Dementia as a whole does not appear to be a risk factor for suicide completion. Nonetheless some subgroups of patients with dementia apparently have an increased risk for suicidal behavior, such as patients with psychiatric comorbidities (particularly depression) and of younger age. Furthermore, a recent diagnosis of dementia, semantic dementia, and previous suicide attempts most probably elevate the risk for suicidal intentions and behavior. The impact of other potential risk factors, such as patient's cognitive impairment profile, behavioral disturbances, social isolation, or a biomarker based presymptomatic diagnosis has not yet been investigated. Assisted dying in dementia is rare but numbers seem to increase in regions where it is legally permitted. Conclusion: Most studies that had investigated the prevalence and risk factors for suicide in dementia had significant methodological limitations. Large prospective studies need to be conducted in order to evaluate risk factors for suicide and assisted suicide in patients with dementia and persons with very early or presymptomatic diagnoses of dementia. In clinical practice, known risk factors for suicide should be assessed in a standardized way so that appropriate action can be taken when necessary.",2017,,International Psychogeriatrics,29,8,1247-1259,,10.1017/S1041610217000679,,#361,Diehl-Schmid 2017

As the majority of patients with PPH are asymptomatic, the diagnosis is often overlooked. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of available scientific evidence on the likelihood of PPH in neurological diseases. Methods: A systematic review of the literature (PubMed library, Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for results up to January 2017) identified 327 studies, of which 11 reported the frequency of PPH in patients with neurological diseases compared to healthy controls. These 11 studies were on patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD; n = 6 studies), multiple system atrophy (MSA; n = 1), Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD; n = 1) and diabetic neuropathy (DN; n = 2).

Embase,Transcranial Doppler screening for stroke risk in children with sickle cell disease: a systematic review,"Mazzucco, S.; Diomedi, M.; Qureshi, A.; Sainati, L.; Padayachee, S.T.","Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common causes of stroke in children worldwide. Based on the results of the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP), annual transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening for affected children is standard practice. However, the need for TCD surveillance programs could override the accuracy of the screening, affecting the correct stratification of stroke risk and subsequent clinical management of the target population. Aims: To shed light on this issue, a systematic review of the literature on TCD screening for children and adolescents with SCD was carried out (CRD42016050549), according to a list of clinically relevant questions, with a particular focus on screening practices in European countries. Quality of the evidence was rated using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation. Summary of review: Thirty-three studies published in English or French were included (5 randomized controlled trials, 8 experimental non-randomized, and 20 observational studies). The quality of the retrieved evidence ranged between low and high, but was rated as moderate or high most of the times. TCD is effective as a screening tool for the primary prevention of stroke in SCD children. There is no high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of alternative screening methods, such as imaging-TCD with or without angle correction or magnetic resonance angiography. No evidence was found on effectiveness of the screening on children on hydroxyurea and with genotypes other than HbSS and HbS/Î_0. No European data were found on screening rates or adherence of screening practices to the STOP protocol. Conclusions: High-quality studies on alternative screening methods that are currently used in real-world practice, and on screening applicability to specific subgroups of patients are urgently needed. Considering the low awareness of the disease in European countries and the lack of data on screening practices and adherence, clinicians need up-to-date guidelines for more uniform and evidence-based surveillance of children with SCD.",2017,,International Journal of Stroke,12,6,580-588,,10.1177/1747493017706189,,#359,Mazzucco 2017
Embase,Drug candidates in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease,"Hung, S.-Y.; Fu, W.-M.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major form of senile dementia, characterized by progressive memory and neuronal loss combined with cognitive impairment. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting one-fifth of those aged over 85 years. Recent therapeutic approaches have been strongly influenced by five neuropathological hallmarks of AD: acetylcholine deficiency, glutamate excitotoxicity, extracellular deposition of amyloid-Î_ (AÎ_ plague), formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs), and neuroinflammation. The lowered concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) in AD result in a progressive and significant loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Current AD medications, memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) alleviate some of these symptoms by enhancing cholinergic signaling, but they are not curative. Since 2003, no new drugs have been approved for the treatment of AD. This article focuses on the current research in clinical trials targeting the neuropathological findings of AD including acetylcholine response, glutamate transmission, AÎ_ clearance, tau protein deposits, and neuroinflammation. These investigations include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, agonists and antagonists of neurotransmitter receptors, Î_-secretase (BACE) or Î_-secretase inhibitors, vaccines or antibodies targeting AÎ_ clearance or tau protein, as well as anti-inflammation compounds. Ongoing Phase III clinical trials via passive immunotherapy against AÎ_ peptides (crenezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab) seem to be promising. Using small molecules blocking 5-HT6 serotonin receptor (intepirdine), inhibiting BACE activity (E2609, AZD3293, and verubecestat), or reducing tau aggregation (TRx0237) are also currently in Phase III clinical trials.

Articles published in English from January 1995 to December 2015 were retrieved for analysis to identify peer-reviewed, observational studies assessing use of preventive medications in patients with LLE. Inclusion criteria were: patients with a LLE (less than or equal to two years); prescribed/used preventive medications. Results Of the 15 studies meeting our eligibility criteria, six were from inpatient hospital settings, five in palliative care, three in nursing homes, and one in community settings. The most common life-limiting illnesses described in the studies were cancer (n = 6), cardiovascular diseases (n = 4), dementia and cognitive impairment (n = 2), and other life-limiting illnesses (n = 3). Lipid-lowering medications, especially the statins were frequently prescribed preventive medication followed by antiplatelets, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-osteoporosis medications, and calcium channel blockers. Only four studies reported the instances of medication withdrawal. Conclusion Patients continue to receive medications that are not prescribed as symptomatic treatment despite having a LLE. Very few rigorous studies have been conducted on minimizing preventive medications in patients with LLE, and expert opinion varies on medication optimization at the end of life. A consensus guideline that addresses this gap is of paramount importance.",2017,,Journal of Pain and Symptom Management,53,6,1097-1110.e1,,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2016.12.350,,#356,Poudel 2017
Embase,Cognitive Impairment and Heart Failure: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Cannon, J.A.; Moffitt, P.; Perez-Moreno, A.C.; Walters, M.R.; Broomfield, N.M.; McMurray, J.J.V.; Quinn, T.J.","Background Cognitive impairment and dementia are associated with a range of cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. We aimed to describe the association with heart failure, summarizing published data to give estimates of prevalence, incidence, and relative risk of cognitive impairment/dementia in heart failure. Methods We searched multidisciplinary databases including MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsychINFO (EBSCO), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) from inception until May 31, 2015. All relevant studies looking at cognitive impairment/dementia in heart failure were included. Studies were selected by 2 independent reviewers using prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Where data allowed, we performed meta-analysis and pooled results using random effects models. Results From 18,000 titles, 37 studies were eligible (n = 8411 participants). Data from 4 prospective cohorts (n = 2513 participants) suggest greater cognitive decline in heart failure compared with non-heart failure over the longer term. These data were not suitable for meta-analysis. In case control studies describing those with and without heart failure (n = 4 papers, 1414 participants) the odds ratio for cognitive impairment in the heart failure population was 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.15â€“2.42). Prevalence of cognitive impairment in heart failure cohorts (n = 26 studies, 4176 participants) was 43% (95% confidence interval 30â€“55). Conclusions This review suggests a substantial proportion of patients with heart failure have concomitant cognitive problems. This has implications for planning treatment and services. These data do not allow us to comment on causation, and further work is needed to describe the underlying pathophysiology.",2017,,Journal of Cardiac Failure,23,6,464-475,,10.1016/j.cardfail.2017.04.007,,#355,Cannon 2017
Embase,Management of depression in older adults: A review,"Kok, R.M.; Reynolds, C.F.","IMPORTANCE Depression in older adults is a common psychiatric disorder affecting their health-related quality of life. Major depression occurs in 2%of adults aged 55 years or older, and its prevalence rises with increasing age. In addition, 10% to 15%of older adults have clinically significant depressive symptoms, even in the absence of major depression. OBSERVATIONS Depression presents with the same symptoms in older adults as it does in younger populations. In contrast to younger patients, older adults with depression more commonly have several concurrent medical disorders and cognitive impairment. Depression occurring in older patients is often undetected or inadequately treated. Antidepressants are the best-studied treatment option, but psychotherapy, exercise therapy, and electroconvulsive therapymay also be effective. Psychotherapy is recommended for patients with mild to moderate severity depression. Many older patients need the same doses of antidepressant medication that are used for younger adult patients. Although antidepressants may effectively treat depression in older adults, they tend to pose greater risk for adverse events because of multiple medical comorbidities and drug-drug interactions in case of polypharmacy. High-quality evidence does not support the use of pharmacologic treatment of depression in patients with dementia. Polypharmacy in older patients can be minimized by using the Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions and Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (STOPP/START) criteria, a valid and reliable screening tool that enables physicians to avoid potentially inappropriate medications, undertreatment, or errors of omissions in older people. Antidepressants can be gradually tapered over a period of several weeks, but discontinuation of antidepressants may be associated with relapse or recurrence of depression, so the patient should be closely observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Major depression in older adults is common and can be effectively treated with antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychological therapies and exercise may also be effective for mild-moderate depression, for patients who prefer nonpharmacological treatment, or for patients who are too frail for drug treatments.",2017,,JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association,317,20,2114-2122,,10.1001/jama.2017.5706,,#354,Kok 2017
Embase,Impact of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in premenopausal women,"Vermeulen, R.F.M.; Beurden, M.; Korse, C.M.; Kenter, G.G.","Objectives: To describe implications of premenopausal risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) on quality of life, endocrine symptoms, sexual function, osteoporosis, cardiovascular health, metabolic syndrome, cognitive impairment and safety of hormone replacement therapy. Methods: We searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and MEDLINE. We selected controlled and uncontrolled trials of premenopausal women undergoing RRSO. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Reference lists of included reports were searched manually for additional studies. Results: Surgical menopause leads to more menopausal complaints and sexual dysfunction than natural menopause. Overall quality of life is not affected by surgery. In the limited literature, there is no evidence that RRSO leads to more osteopenia in comparison with natural menopause at a young age. Cohort studies show a slight impaired cardiovascular health. Cognitive function decreases later in life in premenopausal oophorectomized women. Short-term hormone replacement therapy seems to decline postmenopausal complaints and does not seem to increase the risk for breast carcinoma in mutation carriers without a personal history of breast carcinoma. Conclusions: The conclusions of this systematic review are limited by the absence of randomized, controlled trials.

Embase,Decreased central nervous system grey matter volume (GMV) in smokers affects cognitive abilities: A systematic review,"VÅˆukovÃ¡, M.; PtÃ¡Äçek, R.; Raboch, J.; Stefano, G.B.","Although cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable mortality, tobacco is consumed by approximately 22% of the adult population worldwide. Smoking is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affects brain processing, and is a recognized risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Tobacco toxins (e.g., nicotine at high levels) inhaled in smoke may cause disorders resulting in preclinical brain changes. Researchers suggest that there are differences in brain volume between smokers and non-smokers. This review examines these differences in brain grey matter volume (GMV). In March/April 2015, MedLine, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched using the terms: â€œgrey matterâ€ù AND â€œvoxel- basedâ€ù AND â€œsmokingâ€ù AND â€œcigaretteâ€ù. The 4 studies analyzed found brain GMV decreases in smokers compared to non-smokers. Furthermore, sexspecific differences were found; while the thalamus and cerebellum were affected in both sexes, decreased GMV in the olfactory gyrus was found only in male smokers. Age-group differences were also found, and these may suggest pre-existing abnormalities that lead to nicotine dependence in younger individuals. Only 1 study found a positive correlation between number of pack-years smoked and GMV. Smoking decreases GMV in most brain areas. This decrease may be responsible for the cognitive impairment and difficulties with emotional regulation found in smokers compared with non-smokers.",2017,,Medical Science Monitor,23,"(VÅˆukovÃ¡ M.; PtÃ¡Äçek R., ptacek@neuro.cz; Raboch J.; Stefano G.B.)

Embase,Chronic kidney disease-related physical frailty and cognitive impairment: a systemic review,"Shen, Z.; Ruan, Q.; Yu, Z.; Sun, Z.","Aim: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms and the interventions. Methods: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the keywords â€œCognitive and CKDâ€ù and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) with the keywords â€œFrailty and CKDâ€ù were included in final analysis. Results: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population. Conclusions: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease.

Embase,Mind over matter? The hidden epidemic of cognitive dysfunction in the older surgical patient,"O'Brien, H.; Mohan, H.; Hare, C.O.; Reynolds, J.V.; Kenny, R.A.","Objective: The aim of this study was to highlight the vulnerability of the aging brain to surgery and anesthesia, examine postoperative cognitive outcomes, and recommend possible interventions. Background: Surgeons are facing increasingly difficult ethical and clinical decisions given the rapidly expanding aging demographic. Cognitive function is not routinely assessed either preoperatively or postoperatively. Potential short and long-term cognitive implications are rarely discussed with the patient despite evidence that postoperative cognitive impairment occurs in up to 65% of older patients. Furthermore, surgery may accelerate the trajectory of cognitive decline and dementia. Methods: An electronic search was conducted using Pubmed/Medline. References from selected studies were cross-referenced and relevant articles retrieved. Data were summarized in a narrative format. Results: There is a hidden epidemic of cognitive dysfunction in the perioperative setting. Up to 40% of patients who develop postoperative delirium (POD) never return to their preoperative cognitive baseline. POD can lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a more prolonged cognitive impairment associated with longer length of hospital stay and cost, premature withdrawal from the workforce, and greater 1-year mortality. Standardized perioperative cognitive assessment is needed to enable progress. Improving outcomes will depend on a multifaceted approach, including correction of modifiable preoperative risk factors and prompt treatment of POD. Risk factors are discussed and possible interventional strategies are presented. Conclusion: Closer preoperative collaboration between surgeons, geriatricians, and anesthetists will enable identification of complex at-risk older patients. A paradigm shift in the approach to management of the older surgical patient is critical to improve postoperative cognitive outcomes in modern surgery.",2017,,Annals of Surgery,265,4,677-691,,10.1097/SLA.0000000000001900,,#347,O'Brien 2017

Cognitive dysfunction has been viewed, however, as a late-stage phenomenon, despite increasing evidence that changes may be detected in the decades preceding dementia. In the absence of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for preclinical cognitive assessment, longitudinal cohort and neuroimaging studies have been reviewed to determine the temporal order and brain biomarker correlates of specific cognitive functions. Episodic memory decline was observed to be the most salient cognitive function, correlating with high levels of amyloid deposition and hypoconnectivity across large-scale brain networks. Prospective studies point to early decline in both episodic and semantic memory processing as well as executive functions in the predementia period. The cognitive tests have, however, been principally those used to diagnose dementia. New procedures are required which target more finely the medial temporal lobe subregions first affected by clinically silent AD pathology.",2017,,Alzheimer's and Dementia,13,4,468-492,,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.2365,,#346,Mortamais 2017
Embase,Factors predicting incidence of post-operative delirium in older people following hip fracture surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Smith, T.O.; Cooper, A.; Peryer, G.; Griffiths, R.; Fox, C.; Cross, J.","Objective: Delirium is one of the most common complications following hip fracture surgery in older people. This study identified pre- and peri-operative factors associated with the development of post-operative delirium following hip fracture surgery. Methods: Published and unpublished literature were searched to identify all evidence reporting variables on patient characteristics, on-admission, intra-operative and post-operative management assessing incident delirium in older people following hip fracture surgery. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and mean difference of those who experienced delirium compared to those who did not were calculated for each variable. Evidence was assessed using the Downs and Black appraisal tool and interpreted using the GRADE approach. Results: A total of 6704 people (2090 people with post-operative delirium) from 32 studies were analysed. There was moderate evidence of nearly a two-times greater probability of post-operative delirium for those aged 80 years and over (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.87), whether patients lived in a care institution pre-admission (OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.79, 3.92), and a six-times greater probability of developing post-operative delirium with a pre-admission diagnosis of dementia (OR: 6.07, 95% CI: 4.84, 7.62). There was no association with intra-operative variables and probability of delirium. Conclusion: Clinicians treating people with a hip fracture should be vigilant towards post-operative delirium if their patients are older, have pre-existing cognitive impairment and poorer overall general health. This is also the case for those who experience post-operative complications such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.

There have been recent calls to action to review the existing literature on co-occurring chronic conditions and dementia in order to better understand the effect of cognitive impairment on disease management, mobility, and mortality. Methods: This systematic literature review searched PubMed databases through 2011 (updated in 2016) using key constructs of older adults, moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (both diagnosed and undiagnosed dementia), and chronic conditions. Reviewers assessed papers for eligibility and extracted key data from each included manuscript. An independent expert panel rated the strength and quality of evidence and prioritized gaps for future study. Results: Four thousand thirty-three articles were identified, of which 147 met criteria for review. We found that moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment increased risks of mortality, was associated with prolonged institutional stays, and decreased function in persons with multiple chronic conditions. There was no relationship between significant cognitive impairment and use of cardiovascular or hypertensive medications for persons with these comorbidities. Prioritized areas for future research include hospitalizations, disease-specific outcomes, diabetes, chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, depression, falls, stroke, and multiple chronic conditions. Conclusions: This review summarizes that living with significant cognitive impairment or dementia negatively impacts mortality, institutionalization, and functional outcomes for people living with multiple chronic conditions. Our findings suggest that chronic-disease management interventions will need to address co-occurring cognitive impairment.

As a consequence, health professionals often face the challenge of managing patients with dementia presenting with an acute stroke. Patients with dementia are less likely to receive thrombolysis (0.56â€“10% vs. 1â€“16% thrombolysis rates in the general population), be admitted to a stroke unit or receive some types of care. Anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention is sometimes withheld, despite dementia not being listed as an exclusion criterion in current guidelines. Studies in this population are scarce, and results have been contradictory. Three observational studies have examined intravenous thrombolysis for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in patients with dementia. In the two largest matched caseâ€“control studies, there were no significant differences between patients with and without dementia in the risks of intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality. The risk of intracerebral haemorrhage ranged between 14% and 19% for patients with dementia. Studies of other interventions for stroke are lacking for this population. Patients with dementia are less likely to be discharged home compared with controls (19% vs. 41%) and more likely to be disabled (64% vs. 59%) or die during hospitalization (22% vs. 11%). The aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge about the management of ischaemic stroke in patients with pre-existing dementia, including organizational aspects of stroke care, intravenous thrombolysis, access to stroke unit care and use of supportive treatment. Evidence to support anticoagulation for secondary prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and antiplatelet therapy in nonembolic stroke will be discussed, as well as rehabilitation and how these factors influence patient outcomes.

We undertook a review to provide an update on the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS that occur in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and just before the onset of MCI. We discuss common clinical presentations and the implications for diagnosis and care. Method: The authors conducted a selective review of the literature regarding the emergence of NPS in late life, before and after the onset of MCI. We discuss recent publications that explore the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS in the earliest clinical stages of these disorders. Results: NPS have been reported in 35% to 85% of adults with MCI and also occur in advance of cognitive decline. The occurrence of NPS for the first time in later life should increase suspicion for an underlying neurocognitive disorder. The presenting symptom may provide a clue regarding the etiology of the underlying disorder, and the co-occurrence of NPS may herald a more accelerated cognitive decline. Conclusions: NPS are prevalent in the early clinical stages of neurocognitive disorders and can serve as both useful diagnostic and prognostic indicators. Recognition of NPS as early manifestations of neurocognitive disorders will become increasingly important as we move towards preventative strategies and disease-modifying treatments that may be most effective when deployed in the earliest stages of disease.",2017,,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,62,3,161-169,,10.1177/0706743716648296,,#338,Gallagher 2017

Objective: We summarize relevant and recent evidence from epidemiological, interventional and experimental studies investigating dietary consumption of omega-3 fatty acids and emphazing mechanisms of memory disorders, with a focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Omega-3 fatty acid could represent an affordable and accessible adjunctive treatment option to improve cognitive and non-cognitive function with a focus on MCI or dementia. However, apart from its translational promise, which is based on mechanistic models and evidence from animal studies, evidence for clinical benefits in humans is lacking.

Embase,Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in reducing grief experienced by family carers of people with dementia: A systematic review,"Wilson, S.; Toye, C.; Aoun, S.; Slatyer, S.; Moyle, W.; Beattie, E.","Background Family carers of people living and dying with dementia experience grief. The prevalence, predictors and associated factors of grief in this population have been identified, and psychosocial interventions to decrease grief symptoms have been implemented. However, the effect of psychosocial interventions on family carersâ€™ grief, loss or bereavement has not been examined. Objective To synthesize the existing evidence regarding the impact of psychosocial interventions to assist adjustment to grief, pre- and post-bereavement, for family carers of people with dementia. Inclusion criteria Types of participants Family carers of older persons with dementia (>65 years). Types of interventions Psychosocial interventions in health and social care facilities, and community settings designed to assist family carers adjust to grief during the dementia trajectory and/or following death. Comparisons No treatment, standard care or treatment as usual, or an alternative intervention. Types of studies Experimental and epidemiological study designs. Outcomes Grief in family carers including anticipatory, complicated and prolonged grief disorder measured with validated instruments. Search strategy A three-step strategy sought to identify both published and unpublished studies from 1995. Methodological quality Assessed by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). Data extraction The standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI was used by two reviewers independently. Data synthesis Statistical pooling of results was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the interventions and the outcome measures. Results Data were extracted from three studies. Study designs were a randomized controlled trial; a pre-test, multiple posttest quasi-experimental; and a single group, repeated measures. The interventions were multi-component, had durations of nine to 26 weeks and were delivered while care recipients were alive. All studies were undertaken in the United States. There were 327 family carers, of which 197 received a psychosocial intervention. Family carers were predominantly female (84.7%), Caucasian (73.4%) and caring for their spouse (44.3%). All care recipients had dementia; 68.5% had Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Two studies measured anticipatory grief, and the third study reported normal and complicated grief. Moderate benefits to anticipatory grief were evident upon completion of the â€œEasing the Wayâ€ù intervention (effect size -0.43, P = 0.03). After controlling for research design and control variables, for every hour increase in the interventions focusing on family carersâ€™ cognitive skills, there were associated decreases in carersâ€™ normal grief (parameter estimate [PE]= -0.81, P = 0.02) and complicated grief (PE=-0.87, P = 0.03). For every hour increase in the interventions focusing on carer behavior, there was an associated decrease in carersâ€™ complicated grief (PE = -1.32, P = 0.04). For every hour increase in the interventions focusing on care recipient behavior, there was an associated decrease in carersâ€™ complicated grief (PE = -2.91, P = 0.04). Conclusion There is little evidence upon which to base practice with regard to interventions to reduce any aspects of grief. Findings suggest that different pre-death interventions might be warranted depending upon a family carerâ€™s unique clinical presentation and combination of risk factors. Cognitive skills training provided while the care recipient is alive may positively impact normal and complicated grief following the death of the care recipient. When the cognitive skills training is provided in conjunction with behaviorally oriented interventions that improve the wellbeing of the carer and care recipient, carersâ€™ complicated grief symptoms may be reduced.",2017,,JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports,15,3,809-839,,10.11124/JBISRIR-2016-003017,,#336,Wilson 2017
Embase,Neurocognitive impairment in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and depression,"Padilla, V.L.; Rustad, J.K.; Harvey, P.D.; Wasserman, B.; Ziemer, D.; Musselman, D.L.","Background: Treatment of depression for individuals with type 2 diabetes improves depressive symptoms, but not glycemic control. For patients with depression and cognitive deficits, adherence to diabetes self-management goals may be especially challenging. Objective: We sought to examine whether neurocognitive dysfunction is associated with impaired diabetes adherence and control, examine the effect of depression, and determine if treatments of neurocognitive dysfunction improved glycemic control and perhaps even depression. Methods: Electronic data searches of PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library (years 2000-2016) were performed using keywords: ""depression"", ""diabetes"", ""cognition"", and ""dementia."" The authors, in consensus, selected pivotal studies and conducted a narrative review of twenty clinical studies. Results: Depression is a risk factor for greater morbidity in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Deficits in cognition and functional capacity are also risk factors and it is likely the case that they have separable influences upon diabetes-relevant outcomes. Support of both provider management, i.e., intensification of antidepressant or hypoglycemic medication dosing, and patient medication adherence, respectively, is associated with both improved glycemic control and depressive symptoms. To date, no studies have systematically identified the cognitive deficits of individuals with diabetes and utilized neuropsychological interventions to surmount such deficits in order to achieve improved glycemic control. Conclusions: Cognitive dysfunction, an important covariate in the relationship between depression and impaired diabetes self-management, can be precisely targeted.

Embase,Treatment of depression in nursing home residents without significant cognitive impairment: A systematic review,"Simning, A.; Simons, K.V.","Background: Depression in nursing facilities is widespread and has been historically under-recognized and inadequately treated. Many interventions have targeted depression among residents with dementia in these settings. Less is known about depression treatment in residents without dementia who may be more likely to return to community living. Our study aimed to systematically evaluate randomized control trials (RCTs) in nursing facilities that targeted depression within samples largely comprised of residents without dementia. Methods: The following databases were evaluated with searches covering January 1991 to December 2015 (PubMed, PsycINFO) and March 2016 (CINAHL). We also examined national and international clinical trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov. RCTs were included if they were published in English, evaluated depression or depressive symptoms as primary or secondary outcomes, and included a sample with a mean age of 65 years and over for which most had no or only mild cognitive impairment. Results: A total of 32 RCTs met our criteria including those testing psychotherapeutic interventions (n=13), psychosocial and recreation interventions (n=9), and pharmacologic or other biologic interventions (n=10). Seven psychotherapeutic, six psychosocial and recreation, and four pharmacologic or other biologic interventions demonstrated a treatment benefit. Conclusions: Many studies had small samples, were of poor methodological quality, and did not select for depressed residents. There is limited evidence suggesting that cognitive behavioral therapies, reminiscence, interventions to reduce social isolation, and exercise-based interventions have some promise for decreasing depression in cognitively intact nursing home residents; little can be concluded from the pharmacologic or other biologic RCTs.",2017,,International Psychogeriatrics,29,2,209-226,,10.1017/S1041610216001733,,#334,Simning 2017

Databases searched included PubMed, Google scholar, CNKI, Wan-Fang, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2016. We only included sham-controlled, randomized clinical trials of CoQ10 intervention for motor dysfunction in patients with PD. Relevant measures were extracted independently by two investigators. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated with random-effects models. Eight studies with a total of 899 patients were included. Random-effects analysis revealed a pooled WMD of 1.02, indicating no significant difference when CoQ10 treatment compared with placebo in terms of UPDRS part 3 (pÂ =Â 0.54). Meanwhile, the effect size of UPDRS part 1, UPDRS part 2, and total UPDRS scores were similar in CoQ10 group with in placebo group (pÂ >Â 0.05). Moreover, we found CoQ10 was well tolerated compared with placebo group. Subgroup analysis showed that the effect size of CoQ10 in monocentric studies was larger than in multicenter studies. Using the GRADE criteria, we characterized the quality of evidence presented in this meta-analysis as moderate to high level. The current meta-analysis provided evidence that CoQ10 was safe and well tolerated in participants with PD and no superior to placebo in terms of motor symptoms. According to these results, we cannot recommend CoQ10 for the routine treatment of PD right now.",2017,,Neurological Sciences,38,2,215-224,,10.1007/s10072-016-2757-9,,#332,Zhu 2017
Embase,Intensive LDL-cholesterol lowering therapy and neurocognitive function,"Banach, M.; Rizzo, M.; Nikolic, D.; Howard, G.; Howard, V.J.; Mikhailidis, D.P.","The key lipid-lowering target is to achieve guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, usually by using statins. The new treatment strategies for lipid-lowering therapy include using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors as an exciting approach to reduce residual risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, concerns about possible adverse effects, including neurocognitive disorders, were issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The current disputable evidence does not allow definite conclusions as to whether statins contribute to, or cause, clinically meaningful cognitive impairment. Some evidence indicates a high rate of memory loss, while other evidence suggests a benefit in dementia prevention. This debate should not discourage appropriate statin and other lipid-lowering drug administration. However, prescribers should be aware of such potential drug-related side effects. Prospective controlled studies comparing the short- and long-term effects of different statins on cognitive function are warranted. The effects of intensive LDL-C lowering on neurocognition might be attributed to an off-target effect. It is also possible that pre-existing pathology and vascular risk may already be present outweighing any effect related to lipids. Gender, genetic, LDL-C-related genotypes and aging-related changes should also be considered. Some data indicate that carriers of apolipoprotein E (apoE) Îµ-4 allele, with low levels of apoA1 and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have a distinct plasma lipid profile and may be more susceptible to neurocognitive dysfunction.

However, benzodiazepines are known to affect memory and cognition and might thus enhance the risk of dementia. The objective of this review is to synthesize evidence from observational studies that evaluated the association between benzodiazepines use and dementia risk. Summary: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies to evaluate the risk of benzodiazepines use on dementia outcome. All control observational studies that compared dementia outcome in patients with benzodiazepine use with a control group were included. We calculated pooled ORs using a random-effects model. Ten studies (of 3,696 studies identified) were included in the systematic review, of which 8 studies were included in random-effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses. Odds of dementia were 78% higher in those who used benzodiazepines compared with those who did not use benzodiazepines (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.33-2.38). In subgroup analysis, the higher association was still found in the studies from Asia (OR 2.40; 95% CI 1.66-3.47) whereas a moderate association was observed in the studies from North America and Europe (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.34-1.65 and OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.16-1.75). Also, diabetics, hypertension, cardiac disease, and statin drugs were associated with increased risk of dementia but negative association was observed in the case of body mass index. There was significant statistical and clinical heterogeneity among studies for the main analysis and most of the sensitivity analyses. There was significant statistical and clinical heterogeneity among the studies for the main analysis and most of the sensitivity analyses. Key Messages: Our results suggest that benzodiazepine use is significantly associated with dementia risk. However, observational studies cannot clarify whether the observed epidemiologic association is a causal effect or the result of some unmeasured confounding variable. Therefore, more research is needed.",2017,,Neuroepidemiology,47,4-Mar,181-191,,10.1159/000454881,,#329,Islam 2017

This study aimed to quantify the prevalence of undetected dementia and to examine its correlates. Methods/setting/participants: A systematic search was conducted until October 2016 for studies reporting the proportion of undetected dementia and/or its determinants in either the community or in residential care settings worldwide. Random-effects models calculated the pooled rate of undetected dementia and subgroup analyses were conducted to identify determinants of the variation. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The outcome measures of interest were the prevalence and determinants of undetected dementia. Results: 23 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. The pooled rate of undetected dementia was 61.7% (95% CI 55.0% to 68.0%). The rate of underdetection was higher in China and India (vs Europe and North America), in the community setting (vs residential/nursing care), age of <70 years, male gender and diagnosis by general practitioner. However, it was lower in the studies using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) diagnosis criteria. Conclusions: The prevalence of undetected dementia is high globally. Wide variations in detecting dementia need to be urgently examined, particularly in populations with low socioeconomic status.

Various definitions of PSCI and PSD have been described. We propose PSD as a label for any dementia following stroke in temporal relation. Various tools are available to screen and assess cognition, with few PSD-specific instruments. Choice will depend on purpose of assessment, with differing instruments needed for brief screening (e.g., Montreal Cognitive Assessment) or diagnostic formulation (e.g., NINDS VCI battery). A comprehensive evaluation should include assessment of pre-stroke cognition (e.g., using Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly), mood (e.g., using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and functional consequences of cognitive impairments (e.g., using modified Rankin Scale). A large number of biomarkers for PSD, including indicators for genetic polymorphisms, biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the serum, inflammatory mediators, and peripheral microRNA profiles have been proposed. Currently, no specific biomarkers have been proven to robustly discriminate vulnerable patients ('at risk brains') from those with better prognosis or to discriminate Alzheimer's disease dementia from PSD. Further, neuroimaging is an important diagnostic tool in PSD. The role of computerized tomography is limited to demonstrating type and location of the underlying primary lesion and indicating atrophy and severe white matter changes. Magnetic resonance imaging is the key neuroimaging modality and has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting pathological changes, including small vessel disease. Advanced multi-modal imaging includes diffusion tensor imaging for fiber tracking, by which changes in networks can be detected. Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow and metabolism by positron emission tomography can differentiate between vascular dementia and degenerative dementia and show the interaction between vascular and metabolic changes. Additionally, inflammatory changes after ischemia in the brain can be detected, which may play a role together with amyloid deposition in the development of PSD. Prevention of PSD can be achieved by prevention of stroke. As treatment strategies to inhibit the development and mitigate the course of PSD, lowering of blood pressure, statins, neuroprotective drugs, and anti-inflammatory agents have all been studied without convincing evidence of efficacy. Lifestyle interventions, physical activity, and cognitive training have been recently tested, but large controlled trials are still missing.",2017,,BMC Medicine,15,1,,,10.1186/s12916-017-0779-7,,#326,MijajloviÄ‡ 2017

Methodological quality of the included SRs was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The quality of evidence of the primary studies was assessed using GRADE. Results Twelve SRs with meta-analyses met the eligibility criteria. The quality of the evidence reported in these SRs varies ranging from low to moderate level. Overall, the available evidence suggests that GbE has potentially beneficial effects over placebo on cognitive performance, activities of daily living, and clinical global impression in the treatment of dementia at doses greater than 200 mg/day (usually 240 mg/day) administrated for 22 weeks or longer, and that GbE appears to be safe for human consumption. No sufficient evidence supports the favorable effects of GbE administrated for less than 22 weeks. The available evidence consistently indicates that a dose less than 200 mg/day of GbE may not be adequate to yield clinical relevant effects in the treatment of dementia. Conclusions GbE has potentially beneficial effects for people with dementia when it is administered at doses greater than 200 mg/day for at least 5 months.

Embase,l-arginine and l-NMMA for assessing cerebral endothelial dysfunction in ischaemic cerebrovascular disease: A systematic review,"Karlsson, W.K.; SÃ¸rensen, C.G.; Kruuse, C.","Endothelial dysfunction (ED), in particular cerebral ED, may be an essential biomarker for ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. However, there is no consensus on methods to best estimate cerebral ED. In this systematic review, we evaluate the use of l-arginine and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) for assessment of cerebral ED. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library was done. We included studies investigating cerebrovascular response to l-arginine or l-NMMA in human subjects with vascular risk factors or ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. Seven studies (315 subjects) were eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies investigated the effect of age (n=2), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (n=1), cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) (n=1), leukoaraiosis (n=1), and prior ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (n=2) on cerebral ED. Most studies applied transcranial Doppler to quantify cerebral ED. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDV) induced by l-arginine was impaired in elderly and subjects with leukoaraiosis, but enhanced in CADASIL patients. Studies including subjects with prior ischaemic stroke or TIA reported both enhanced and impaired EDV to l-arginine. Responses to l-NMMA deviated between subjects with type 2 DM and the elderly. We found only few studies investigating cerebral endothelial responses to l-arginine and l-NMMA in subjects with vascular risk factors or ischaemic cerebrovascular disease. Inconsistencies in results were most likely due to variations in methods and included subject populations. In order to use cerebral ED as a prognostic marker, further studies are required to evaluate the association to cerebrovascular disease.",2017,,Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology,44,1,13-20,,10.1111/1440-1681.12679,,#322,Karlsson 2017
Embase,"Lifestyle use of drugs by healthy people for enhancing cognition, creativity, motivation and pleasure","d'Angelo, L.-S.C.; Savulich, G.; Sahakian, B.J.","Today, there is continued, and in some cases growing, availability of not only psychoactive substances, including treatments for mental health disorders such as cognitive enhancers, which can enhance or restore brain function, but also â€˜recreationalâ€™ drugs such as novel psychoactive substances (NPS). The use of psychoactive drugs has both benefits and risks: whilst new drugs to treat cognitive symptoms in neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders could have great benefits for many patient groups, the increasing ease of accessibility to recreational NPS and the increasing lifestyle use of cognitive enhancers by healthy people means that the effective management of psychoactive substances will be an issue of increasing importance. Clearly, the potential benefits of cognitive enhancers are large and increasingly relevant, particularly as the population ages, and for this reason, we should continue to devote resources to the development of cognitive enhancers as treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. However, the increasing use of cognitive enhancers by healthy individuals raises safety, ethical and regulatory concerns, which should not be ignored. Similarly, understanding the short- and long-term consequences of the use of NPS, as well as better understanding the motivations and profiles of users could promote more effective prevention and harm reduction measures.

Comparison to an alternative cognitive assessment tool was required in nonremote populations. Case control analyses were excluded. Results: Four studies were included: one of the KICA-Cog and KICA-Carer, one of the KICA Screen, and two of the modified-KICA. All tools developed for remote populations had a sensitivity of â‰¥76% and a specificity of â‰¥71% for the diagnosis of dementia. The KICA-Cog and KICA-Carer conducted in series had the highest sensitivity and specificity (91% and 94% respectively). In an urban and regional population, the mKICA had similar accuracy to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (AUC 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99 vs 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99). Key risk of bias limitations related to lack of pre-determined cut-points and population selection methods.

A gold standard therapy would be treatment to slow or halt disease progression; however, knowledge of causation in the early stages of AD is very limited. In order to determine effective endpoints for possible therapies, a number of quantitative surrogate markers of disease progression have been suggested, including biochemical and imaging biomarkers. The dynamics of these various surrogate markers over time, particularly in relation to disease development, are, however, not well characterized. We reviewed the literature for studies that measured cerebrospinal fluid or plasma amyloid-Î_ and tau, or took magnetic resonance image or fluorodeoxyglucose/Pittsburgh compound B-positron electron tomography scans, in longitudinal cohort studies. We summarized the properties of the major cohort studies in various countries, commonly used diagnosis methods and study designs. We have concluded that additional studies with repeat measures over time in a representative population cohort are needed to address the gap in knowledge of AD progression.

Identification of biological mechanismscommonfor depression and vascular pathology at microvascular level, and understanding their clinical significance may contribute to better treatment and prognosis of this combined physical/psychiatric disorder. Evidence Acquisition: We searched the PubMed computer database for the following key words ""Microvascular AND Depression"" on the 28th of October, 2015 to obtain relevant articles, which were consequently summarized to facilitate further research in the field of psychiatry. Results: The majority of studies support the suggestion that microvascular abnormality is associated with depression even if several documents do not necessarily support this idea. It seems probable that microvascular abnormality is only relevant in particular subtypes of depression, for example depression due to a general medical condition, late-life depression, or pharmacoresistant depression. The biological mechanisms by which microvascular abnormality is interconnected with depression may cover genetics, epigenetics, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation or hyperhomocysteinemia. Conclusions: Further research should be aimed at identifying biological mechanisms common in depression and microvascular pathology, including genetics and epigenetics, longitudinal studies of this subcategory of patients with depression, and possible pharmacotherapy overcoming the usual non-responsiveness. An active detection and aggressive treatment of physical diseases associated with microvascular pathology and depression, like hypertension, diabetes or inflammation, is warranted.

Embase,Systematic review of interventions for treating or preventing antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia,"Bergman, H.; Walker, D.-M.; Nikolakopoulou, A.; Soares-Weiser, K.; Adams, C.E.","Background: Antipsychotic medication can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD)-late-onset, involuntary, repetitive movements, often involving the face and tongue. TD occurs in > 20% of adults taking antipsychotic medication (first-generation antipsychotics for > 3 months), with this proportion increasing by 5% per year among those who continue to use these drugs. The incidence of TD among those taking newer antipsychotics is not different from the rate in people who have used older-generation drugs in moderate doses. Studies of TD have previously been found to be limited, with no treatment approach shown to be effective. Objectives: To summarise the clinical effectiveness and safety of treatments for TD by updating past Cochrane reviews with new evidence and improved methods; to undertake public consultation to gauge the importance of the topic for people living with TD/the risk of TD; and to make available all data from relevant trials. Data sources: All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Review methods: Cochrane review methods, network meta-analysis (NMA). Design: Systematic reviews, patient and public involvement consultation and NMA. Setting: Any setting, inpatient or outpatient. Participants: For systematic reviews, adults with TD who have been taking a stable antipsychotic drug dose for > 3 months. Interventions: Any, with emphasis on those relevant to UK NHS practice. Main outcome measures: Any measure of TD, global assessments and adverse effects/events. Results: We included 112 studies (nine Cochrane reviews). Overall, risk of bias showed little sign of improvement over two decades. Taking the outcome of â€˜TD symptoms improved to a clinically important extentâ€™, we identified two trials investigating reduction of antipsychotic dose [n = 17, risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.04; very low quality]. Switching was investigated twice in trials that could not be combined (switching to risperidone vs. antipsychotic withdrawal: one RCT, n = 42, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89; low quality; switching to quetiapine vs. haloperidol: one RCT, n = 45, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22; low quality). In addition to RCTs, six observational studies compared antipsychotic discontinuation with decreased or increased dosage, and there was no clear evidence that any of these strategies had a beneficial effect on TD symptoms (very low-quality evidence). We evaluated the addition to standard antipsychotic care of several treatments, but not anticholinergic treatments, for which we identified no trials. We found no clear effect of the addition of either benzodiazepines (two RCTs, n = 32, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.09; very low quality) or vitamin E (six RCTs, n = 264, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01; low quality). Buspirone as an adjunctive treatment did have some effect in one small study (n = 42, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84; low quality), as did hypnosis and relaxation (one RCT, n = 15, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.94; very low quality).

The NMA model found indirect estimates to be imprecise and failed to produce useful summaries on relative effects of interventions or interpretable results for decision-making. Consultation with people with/at risk of TD highlighted that management of TD remains a concern, and found that people are deeply disappointed at the length of time it has taken researchers to address the issue. Limitations: Most studies remain small and poorly reported. Conclusions: Clinicians, policy-makers and people with/at risk of TD are little better informed than they were decades ago.

Embase,Vitamin D and its association with memory and learning: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Amraei, M.; Mohamadpour, R.; Moayeri, A.; Abbasi, N.; Shirzadpour, E.; Mohamadpour, M.","Vitamin D, which can protect the nervous system, has been associated with increased learning and memory function in studies that have also confirmed a relationship between hypovitaminosis D and cognitive decline. Clinical research, however, has not been promising in this regard and has failed to verify the association between increased vitamin D levels and improved cognitive outcomes. To address this gap, a systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted to determine the relationship of vitamin D with learning and memory. For this purpose, the ISI, PubMed, and SCOPUS databases were searched for related studies published from 2000 to 2016.

Results showed that although serum levels of vitamin D were positively correlated with memory, learning, and improved cognitive and executive dysfunction, this relationship was not significant (summary OR=1.13, 95% CI: 0.57, 1.68). On the basis of years of study, no correlation was found between the effects of vitamin D and memory and learning. Our findings support the association between serum levels of vitamin D and memory, learning, and improved executive cognitive dysfunction despite the lack of significance in such relationship.

The Present systematic review outlines the currently available data on lycopene sources, structure, its absorption, and its beneficial role in chronic diseases. It shows protective against alzheimer disease by improving cognitive functions by protecting oxidative damage of mitochondrial enzymes and preventing apoptosis. Systemic inflammation exacerbates more co-morbidities in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases lycopene attenuates this condition by its antioxidant property.

Objective: The present review is aimed to report the new developments of the efficacy and safety of DNA vaccines for AD in animal models. Method: The method PRISMA was used for this review. The article search was made in the electronic databases PubMed, LILACS, and Scopus using the descriptors ""Alzheimer disease"" and ""Vaccine, DNA"". Articles published between January 2001 and September 2017 in English, Portuguese, and Spanish were included. Results: Upon the consensus, the researchers identified 28 original articles. The studies showed satisfying results as for the decrease of amyloid plaques in mouse, rabbits, and monkeys brains using mostly the DNA A42 vaccine, AV-1955, and AdPEDI-(A1-6)11, mainly with a gene gun. In addition to a reduction in tau by the first DNA vaccine (AV-1980D) targeting this protein. The use of adjuvants and boosters also had positive results as they increased the destruction of the amyloid plaques and induced an anti-inflammatory response profile without side effects. Conclusion: The results of DNA vaccines targeting the amyloid-and the tau protein with or without adjuvants and boosters were promising in reducing amyloid plaques and tau protein without side effects in animals. Although there are many vaccines being tested in animals, few reach clinical trials. Thus, as a future perspective, we suggest that clinical studies should be conducted with vaccines that have been promising in animal models (e.g., DNA A42 vaccine, AV-1955, and AdPEDI-(A1-6)11).",2017,,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease Reports,1,1,195-217,,10.3233/ADR-170025,,#305,Martins 2017

A systematic review of the evidence,"Bird, M.; Anderson, K.; Macpherson, S.; Blair, A.","Background: Common sense suggests and research indicates relationships between staff factors in residential dementia care and quality of life (QOL) for residents, with poor care increasing suffering. However, we do not have a coherent picture of which staff interventions have an impact on quality of care (QOC) or resident QOL. Methods: A comprehensive search of 20 years' peer-reviewed literature using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane, Campbell Collaboration identified 4,760 studies meriting full text review. Forty-six met the inclusion criteria, namely interventions in long-term facilities helping staff develop their capacity to provide better care and/or QOL for residents with dementia. Thirty-five other papers comprised an associated predictor review. Results: Conclusions from these limited data are further compromised because nine studies failed to measure effects on residents and only half assessed effects after the project team withdrew. Of these, excellent studies produced change over the medium (3-4 months) or longer term, including reduction in challenging behavior and restraint use but this applied only to a minority. A number of studies failed to measure effects on QOC, limiting conclusions about mechanisms underlying change. Conclusion: In general, level of intervention required depended on the target. For outcomes like restraint use, structured education sessions with some support appear adequate. Programs to reduce pain require more support. For complicated issues like challenging behavior and increasing co-operation in showering, detailed, supportive, on-site interventions are required.

Ginseng is well-known worldwide as a medicinal plant. Its traditional and modern medicinal applications have been well documented. This medicinal plant is of great value to the people of Korea, China, and Japan and has been used for many purposes. Though all the parts of these plants have medicinal value, the roots are used most extensively in traditional medicine, especially for its curative and restorative properties. Ginseng is used to treat a variety of illnesses in traditional medicine. It is most effective for impotence, insomnia, anorexia, hypodynamia, diabetes, palpitation, shortness of breath, and hemorrhage. From a modern medical point of view, ginseng possesses a variety of constituents, including ginsenosides, polysaccharides, peptides, and polyacetylenic alcohols that have been used effectively for the central nervous system,neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and anticancer effects. In particular, ginsenosides as an active ingredient have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and immunostimulant properties.

Areas covered: We update meta-analyses on NSAIDs in patients with and without cardiovascular (CV) diseases and analyse the association between NSAIDs and cardiovascular events in patients with inflammation. We demonstrate the substantial influence of an indication bias and confounding, which falsely increase the CV risk. We demonstrate protective cardiovascular effects of NSAIDs due to their anti-inflammatory activity, in particular in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or inflammatory pain. Expert commentary: t-NSAIDs and Coxibes drugs resemble in their observed CV risk which, in contrast, reflects the intrinsic risk of patients with pain and inflammation.

Purpose: To summarize the literature comparing a Mediterranean diet with unrestricted fat intake with other diets regarding their effects on health outcomes in adults. Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from 1990 through April 2016. Study Selection: Controlled trials of 100 or more persons followed for at least 1 year for mortality, cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes, and adherence outcomes, as well as cohort studies for cancer outcomes. Data Extraction: Data extracted by 1 investigator was verified by another. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence. Data Synthesis: Two primary prevention trials found no difference in all-cause mortality between diet groups. One large primary prevention trial found that a Mediterranean diet resulted in a lower incidence of major cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.56 to 0.90]), breast cancer (HR, 0.43 [CI, 0.21 to 0.88]), and diabetes (HR, 0.70 [CI, 0.54 to 0.92]). Pooled analyses of primary prevention cohort studies showed that compared with the lowest quantile, the highest quantile of adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduction in total cancer mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [CI, 0.82 to 0.91]; 13 studies) and in the incidence of total (RR, 0.96 [CI, 0.95 to 0.97]; 3 studies) and colorectal (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.84 to 0.98; 9 studies]) cancer. Of 3 secondary prevention studies reporting cardiovascular outcomes, 1 found a lower risk for recurrent myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death with the Mediterranean diet. There was inconsistent, minimal, or no evidence pertaining to any other outcome, including adherence, hypertension, cognitive function, kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and quality of life. Limitations: Few trials; medium risk-of-bias ratings for many studies; low or insufficient strength of evidence for outcomes; heterogeneous diet definitions and components. Conclusion: Limited evidence suggests that a Mediterranean diet with no restriction on fat intake may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus but may not affect all-cause mortality.",2016,,Annals of Internal Medicine,165,7,491-500,,10.7326/M16-0361,,#294,Bloomfield 2016
Embase,Preventing delirium in dementia: Managing risk factors,"Ford, A.H.","Delirium is a common, disabling medical condition that is associated with numerous adverse outcomes. A number of inter-related factors, including pre-existing cognitive impairment, usually contribute to the development of delirium in a particular susceptible individual. Non-pharmacological approaches to prevention typically target multiple risk factors in a systematic manner (multicomponent interventions). There is generally good evidence that multicomponent interventions reduce the incidence of delirium in hospital populations but there are limited data in people with dementia and those living in the community. It is likely that there is a differential effect of specific interventions in those with cognitive impairment (e.g. people with dementia may respond better to simpler, more pragmatic interventions rather than complex procedures) but this cannot be determined from the existing data. Targeted interventions focussed on hydration, medication rationalization and sleep promotion may also be effective in reducing the incidence of delirium, as well as the active involvement of family members in the care of the elderly hospitalized patient.

The aim of this paper is to review the current literature regarding the association between suicide risk and AD in an effort to identify the most relevant risk and protective factors for suicide. A detailed strategy was used to search for relevant articles in Pubmed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Science Direct on suicidal behavior and AD for the period of January 1980 to August 2015. The search yielded 164 articles, of which 21 met our inclusion criteria. Eight crosssectional, two longitudinal, 3 retrospective, and eight case reports (of 11 patients) examined the association between suicide risk and AD. Suicide occurs in AD even many years after the diagnosis of dementia, and patients who have attempted suicide once are at a higher risk of dying from suicide.

Starting from the intrinsic properties of the compounds, we explain their specific action in patients with AD and the most common types of dementia. The pharmacological actions of curcumin, resveratrol and tea catechins have mainly been attributed to their antioxidant activity, interaction with cell signaling pathways, anti-inflammatory effect, chelation of metal ions, and neuroprotection. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies on polyphenols have demonstrated that they may play an integral role in preventing and treating diseases associated with neurodegeneration.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to January 30, 2015. We included prospective and retrospective comparative studies of women with benign hysterectomy who had either bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) or conservation of one or both ovaries. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Reviewers double-screened 5,568 citations and extracted eligible studies into customized forms. Twenty-six comparative studies met inclusion criteria. Studies were assessed for results, quality, and strength of evidence. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Studies were extracted for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcomes data. When compared with hysterectomy with BSO, prevalence of reoperation and ovarian cancer was higher in women with ovarian conservation (ovarian cancer risk of 0.14-0.7% compared with 0.02-0.04% among those with BSO). Hysterectomy with BSO was associated with a lower incidence of breast and total cancer, but no difference in the incidence of cancer mortality was found when compared with ovarian conservation. All-cause mortality was higher in women younger than age 45 years at the time of BSO who were not treated with estrogen replacement therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.92). Coronary heart disease (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.54) and cardiovascular death were higher among women with BSO (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.27-2.68), especially women younger than 45 years who were not treated with estrogen. Finally, there was an increase in the prevalence of dementia and Parkinson disease among women with BSO compared with conservation, especially in women younger than age 50 years.

Guided by the Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health by WHO we reviewed the literature to examine the association between a range of social correlates (eg, sex, age, education, income, urbanicity, marital status, and regional differences) and mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in China and India, the most populous countries in the world. We looked for papers on mental, neurological, and substance use disorders with location identifiers and socioeconomic correlates published between 1990 and 2015 and our search found 65 relevant studies from China and 29 from India. Several association patterns between social correlates and mental, neurological, and substance use disorders were not consistent with those reported in high-income countries, including a high concentration of middle-aged men with alcohol use disorders in China and to a lesser extent in India, and a positive association between being married and depression among women in India. Consistent with previous global reports, low education and poverty were associated with higher occurrence of dementia in both China and India, although there is evidence of an interaction between education and income in the risk for dementia in China. Large variations across regions and ethnic groups were consistently documented in China. These unique correlation patterns for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders identified in China and India emphasise the importance of understanding the local social context when planning targeted strategies to reduce the burden of these disorders.

Embase,What's New in the Management of Neuromuscular Scoliosis,"Brooks, J.T.; Sponseller, P.D.","Background: Patients with neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) can pose treatment challenges related to medical comorbidities and altered spinopelvic anatomy. We reviewed the recent literature regarding evaluation and management of NMS patients and explored areas where further research is needed. Methods: We searched the PubMed database for all papers related to the treatment of NMS published from January 1, 2011 through July 31, 2014, yielding 70 papers. Results: A total of 39 papers contributed compelling new findings. Steroid treatment has been most promising in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, leading to a significantly lower death rate, better pulmonary function, and longer independent ambulation. Growing rods in early-onset NMS were shown to result in significant improvements in major Cobb angles and pelvic obliquity, with low complication rates in patients with spinal muscular atrophy but high infection rates in those with cerebral palsy. Early reports of magnetic growing rods in NMS patients are favorable. Intraoperative neural monitoring is variable in this patient population; however, use of transcranial motor-evoked potentials in NMS patients seems to be safe. Blood loss is the highest in NMS patients when compared with all other diagnostic categories. However, tranexamic acid seems to significantly lower intraoperative blood loss. In a multicenter study, patients diagnosed with NMS had the highest surgical-site infection rate at 13.1%. Best-practice guidelines have been created regarding prevention of infection in NMS patients. Preoperative nutritional optimization and postoperative nutritional supplementation seem to help with lowering the infection rate in these patients. Conclusions: There have been major advances in the management of NMS patients, but many challenges remain.

Embase,Cognitive Tests and Determining Fitness to Drive in Dementia: A Systematic Review,"Bennett, J.M.; Chekaluk, E.; Batchelor, J.","Evidence has shown that although all individuals with dementia will eventually need to stop driving, most can continue to drive safely early in the disease. Fitness to drive needs to be monitored, and the use of cognitive testing to determine driver safety has been suggested. This review is the first to examine cognitive test results pertaining only to individuals with dementia. The aim was to examine the relationship between cognitive tests and driving to determine whether a cognitive assessment can be implemented as a tool to examine driver safety. A systematic review of 28 studies investigating the relationship between cognitive functioning and driving in individuals with dementia was conducted. The results of this review demonstrated a lack of consistency in the findings, with some studies showing a relationship between cognitive testing and driving performance for individuals with dementia, whereas others did not. Results relating to individual cognitive tests and measures confined to a single cognitive domain were variable and not consistently associated with driving performance. Studies consistently found that composite batteries predicted driving performance. The findings from this review support the use of composite batteries comprising multiple individual tests from different cognitive domains in predicting driving performance for individuals with dementia. Scores on individual tests or tests of a single cognitive domain did not predict driver safety. The composite batteries that researchers have examined are not clinically usable because they lack the ability to discriminate sufficiently between safe and unsafe drivers. Researchers need to develop a reliable, valid composite battery that can correctly determine driver safety in individuals with dementia.",2016,,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,64,9,1904-1917,,10.1111/jgs.14180,,#284,Bennett 2016

However, little is known about the prevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment not dementia in ethnically diverse populations, such as indigenous populations conceptualized as groups of persons who self-identify as indigenous and who are recognized as distinctive communities reproducing ancestral, historical, and territorial culture. This is particularly relevant in view of increasing life expectancy in indigenous populations and, consequently, in the number of elderly people, as well as the changes in their multimorbidity profile. In this study, a systematic review of the literature on the subject ""cognitive impairment in indigenous elderly population"" in the databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Lilacs, and Scopus showed that the prevalence of dementia in indigenous populations between 45 and 94 years old, originally from different countries, varied between 0.5% and 26.8% for age 60 and older, whereas the prevalence of cognitive impairment not dementia varied between 4.4% and 17.7%. Early onset of the disease, older age, low education level, and several poor health conditions were associated with prevalence rates and conversion from normal to any cognitive impairment. Cultural inadequacy of neuropsychological tests was the main factor reported in the selected studies, which makes the investigation of dementia a challenge in indigenous populations. These data reveal that the prevalence rates of dementia ranged from low to very high for those aged 60 years and older, with early onset of the disease and elevated mortality rate after initial diagnosis compared with the current global prevalence studies, suggesting that these individuals may be more vulnerable to cognitive disorders.

We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions tested in transgenic mouse models of AD. We searched electronically for publications testing interventions in transgenic models of AD. We extracted data for outcome, study characteristics and reported study quality and calculated summary estimates of efficacy using random effects meta-analysis. We identified 427 publications describing 357 interventions in 55 transgenic models, involving 11,118 animals in 838 experiments. Of concern, reported study quality was relatively low; fewer than one in four publications reported the blinded assessment of outcome or random allocation to group and no study reported a sample size calculation. Additionally, there were few data for any individual interventionâ€”only 16 interventions had outcomes described in 5 or more publications. Finally, â€œtrim and fillâ€ù analyses suggested one in seven pathological and neurobehavioural experiments remain unpublished. Given these historical weaknesses in the in vivo modelling of AD in transgenic animals and the identified risks of bias, clinical trials that are based on claims of efficacy in animals should only proceed after a detailed critical appraisal of those animal data.",2016,,Evidence-based Preclinical Medicine,3,1,23-Dec,,10.1002/ebm2.15,,#281,Egan 2016

Studies were included in the qualitative review if they (1) enrolled participants with diagnosis of Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, or any other neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders; (2) assessed the efficacy of quetiapine; and (3) evaluated psychotic and motor outcomes using validated tools. Of the 341 manuscripts identified, 7 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The studies' risk of bias was considered low. A total of 241 participants enrolled in these trials. Heterogeneity was high due to inclusion criteria, user definitions, assessment tools, and study design. Although not causing any motor deterioration, quetiapine failed to significantly reduce psychotic symptoms compared to placebo when objectively assessed on the Brief Psychotic Rating Scale, the most frequently reported scale in these studies. High loss to follow-up and dropout rates as well as significant improvement in psychotic symptoms in the placebo groups may have affected measurements of possible positive medication effects.",2016,,Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology,29,4,227-236,,10.1177/0891988716640378,,#279,Desmarais 2016
Embase,Orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: Causation or association?,"McDonald, C.; Newton, J.L.; Burn, D.J.","Orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and significantly impair quality of life. Orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment appear to be interrelated. Whether the relationship is causative or associative remains unclear. The vascular hypothesis proposes that recurrent episodic hypotension results in cerebral hypoperfusion, in turn causing anoxic damage to vulnerable areas of the brain and impaired cognitive function. Support for this hypothesis has come from brain MRI studies showing an association between white matter hyperintensities and a postural drop in blood pressure among PD patients. Alternatively, the association between orthostatic hypotension and cognitive decline in PD may reflect shared underlying synuclein-related pathology affecting common neuroanatomical and neurochemical substrates. Cardiac imaging studies demonstrate noradrenergic denervation early in PD, and cardiac denervation has been associated with poorer cognition. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension occurs as a result of defective norepinephrine release from sympathetic terminals upon standing. Neuropathological studies have also demonstrated Lewy body pathology in the locus coeruleus; the main source of noradrenaline in the brain. Locus coeruleus norepinephrine levels are reduced in PD patients with dementia when compared with PD patients without. In this review, we examine the evidence for an association between orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment in PD. We evaluate the literature supporting the hypothesis that progressive noradrenergic denervation underlies both orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment, and we examine studies suggesting that recurrent cerebral hypoperfusion results in cognitive decline in PD. Finally, we explore how modulation of blood pressure and the noradrenergic nervous system may improve cognition in PD.

No structured critical evaluation has been conducted to study this association yet. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically examine the association of poor gait performance with incidence of dementia. Methods: An English and French Medline search was conducted in June 2015, with no limit of date, using the medical subject headings terms ""Gait"" OR ""Gait Disorders, Neurologic"" OR ""Gait Apraxia"" OR ""Gait Ataxia"" AND ""Dementia"" OR ""Frontotemporal Dementia"" OR ""Dementia, Multi-Infarct"" OR ""Dementia, Vascular"" OR ""Alzheimer Disease"" OR ""Lewy Body Disease"" OR ""Frontotemporal Dementia With Motor Neuron Disease"" (Supplementary Concept). Poor gait performance was defined by standardized tests of walking, and dementia was diagnosed according to international consensus criteria. Four etiologies of dementia were identified: any dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and non-AD (ie, pooling VaD, mixed dementias, and other dementias). Fixed effects meta-analyses were performed on the estimates in order to generate summary values. Results: Of the 796 identified abstracts, 12 (1.5%) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Poor gait performance predicted dementia [pooled hazard ratio (HR) combined with relative risk and odds ratio = 1.53 with P < .001 for any dementia, pooled HR = 1.79 with P < .001 for VaD, HR = 1.89 with P value < .001 for non-AD]. Findings were weaker for predicting AD (HR = 1.03 with P value = .004). Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that poor gait performance predicts dementia. This association depends on the type of dementia; poor gait performance is a stronger predictor of non-AD dementias than AD.",2016,,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,17,6,482-490,,10.1016/j.jamda.2015.12.092,,#276,Beauchet 2016

Herein we review and quantitatively summarize the evidence from epidemiological studies. Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed and Cochrane Library Register of Controlled Trials through 20 December 2015. The DerSimonian and Laird random effect model was adopted as the pooling method. Twelve studies from nine articles with 11,463 participants were included. The pooled RR of observational studies was 1.36 (95 CI, 0.83-2.24; I2 = 94.9) for antipsychotic drugs users versus individuals who were not exposed to antipsychotic drugs. When the three studies that were key contributors to the high heterogeneity were excluded, the pooled RR was 2.08 (95 CI 1.39 to 3.13). The result of one double-blind randomized clinical trial indicated that antipsychotic drugs nearly doubled the risk of death in AD patients. In conclusion, there is no evidence of absence of association between antipsychotic drugs' use with death risk of AD patients. Careful assessments of potential benefits and risks should be made before prescribing antipsychotics for treatment of psychosis symptoms and behavioral problems of AD patients.",2016,,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,52,2,631-639,,10.3233/JAD-151207,,#272,Zhai 2016

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in prolonged survival, leading to an increase in complications previously recognized in adults. Children with HIV infection have increased risk of cerebrovascular disease from multiple aetiologies including HIV-associated vasculopathy, opportunistic vasculitis, cardioembolism or coagulopathy, all of which may be secondary to the infection. Prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in HIV-infected children is underestimated because of limited neuroimaging in low and middle income countries, silent events without overt motor manifestations, and mislabeling as HIV encephalopathy for non-motor manifestations such as behavioural and cognitive difficulties. No management guidelines for cerebrovascular disease in HIV-infected children exist but common practices target risk factors for stroke in low and middle income countries.

Chief among these is the question of how best to disclose amyloid imaging research results to individuals who have cognitive symptoms that could impede comprehension of the information conveyed. We systematically developed and evaluated informational materials for use in pre-test counseling and post-test disclosures of amyloid imaging research results in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using simulated sessions, persons with MCI and their family care partners (N = 10 dyads) received fictitious but realistic information regarding brain amyloid status, followed by an explanation of how results impact Alzheimer's disease risk. Satisfaction surveys, comprehension assessments, and focus group data were analyzed to evaluate the materials developed. The majority of persons with MCI and their care partners comprehended and were highly satisfied with the information presented. Focus group data reinforced findings of high satisfaction and included 6 recommendations for practice: 1) offer pre-test counseling, 2) use clear graphics, 3) review participants' own brain images during disclosures, 4) offer take-home materials, 5) call participants post-disclosure to address emerging questions, and 6) communicate seamlessly with primary care providers.

Embase,"The effect of lithium on hematopoietic, mesenchymal and neural stem cells","Ferensztajn-Rochowiak, E.; Rybakowski, J.K.","Lithium has been used in modern psychiatry for more than 65 years, constituting a cornerstone for the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. A number of biological properties of lithium have been discovered, including its hematological, antiviral and neuroprotective effects. In this article, a systematic review of the effect of lithium on hematopoietic, mesenchymal and neural stem cells is presented. The beneficial effects of lithium on the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and growth factors have been reported since 1970s. Lithium improves homing of stem cells, the ability to form colonies and HSC self-renewal. Lithium also exerts a favorable influence on the proliferation and maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Studies on the effect of lithium on neurogenesis have indicated an increased proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and enhanced mitotic activity of Schwann cells. This may be connected with the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of lithium, reflected in an improvement in synaptic plasticity promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis. In clinical studies, lithium treatment increases cerebral gray matter, mainly in the frontal lobes, hippocampus and amygdala. Recent findings also suggest that lithium may reduce the risk of dementia and exert a beneficial effect in neurodegenerative diseases. The most important mediators and signaling pathways of lithium action are the glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Wnt/Î_-catenin pathways. Recently, to study of bipolar disorder pathogenesis and the mechanism of lithium action, the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) obtained from bipolar patients have been used.",2016,,Pharmacological Reports,68,2,224-230,,10.1016/j.pharep.2015.09.005,,#269,Ferensztajn-Rochowiak 2016
Embase,Successful Use of Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator as Treatment for a Patient with Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy: A Case Report and Review of Literature,"Khan, M.T.; Murray, A.; Smith, M.","Background Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is considered a common cause of hereditary stroke caused by mutation of the NOTCH3 gene. Evidence against the use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) has been suggested due to possibility of hemorrhage. We present a case of a patient with CADASIL who was successfully treated using IV tPA. Methods A case description of a female patient who presented with stroke-like symptoms was a previously known case of CADASIL. Review of literature was done using search terms such as CADASIL, NOTCH3, and intracranial hemorrhage or brain hemorrhage. Results A 35-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, and motor aphasia with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 8. The patient was a previously diagnosed case of CADASIL with a positive NOTCH3 mutation. Computed tomography scan showed no large vessel occlusion with no perfusion deficient. Patient was within window for IV tPA treatment which was administered, and she subsequently had marked improvement of all symptoms. Conclusion There is slight evidence against the use of IV tPA for CADASIL patients who present with stroke-like symptoms but nothing is concrete. It has also been suggested that some patients who are undiagnosed have been treated with IV tPA with favorable results but unfortunately are not reported. Further studies and or large clinical trials could be beneficial for those patients who may benefit from IV tPA and who have previously been diagnosed with CADASIL.",2016,,Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases,25,4,e53-e57,,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.12.006,,#268,Khan 2016

Embase,Folic acid and l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate: Comparison of clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,"Pietrzik, K.; Bailey, L.; Shane, B.","There is a large body of evidence to suggest that improving periconceptional folate status reduces the risk of neonatal neural tube defects. Thus increased folate intake is now recommended before and during the early stages of pregnancy, through folic acid supplements or fortified foods. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that folic acid may have a role in the prevention of other diseases, including dementia and certain types of cancer.Folic acid is a synthetic form of the vitamin, which is only found in fortified foods, supplements and pharmaceuticals. It lacks coenzyme activity and must be reduced to the metabolically active tetrahydrofolate form within the cell. L-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (L-5-methyl-THF) is the predominant form of dietary folate and the only species normally found in the circulation, and hence it is the folate that is normally transported into peripheral tissues to be used for cellular metabolism. L-5-methyl-THF is also available commercially as a crystalline form of the calcium salt (MetafolinÂ®), which has the stability required for use as a supplement.Studies comparing L-5-methyl-THF and folic acid have found that the two compounds have comparable physiological activity, bioavailability and absorption at equimolar doses. Bioavailability studies have provided strong evidence that L-5-methyl-THF is at least as effective as folic acid in improving folate status, as measured by blood concentrations of folate and by functional indicators of folate status, such as plasma homocysteine.Intake of L-5-methyl-THF may have advantages over intake of folic acid. First, the potential for masking the haematological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency may be reduced with L-5-methyl-THF. Second, L-5-methyl-THF may be associated with a reduced interaction with drugs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase. Â© 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

Embase,Intravenous immunoglobulins as a treatment for alzheimers disease: Rationale and current evidence,"Dodel, R.; Neff, F.; Noelker, C.; Pul, R.; Du, Y.; Bacher, M.; Oertel, W.","Current treatment options for Alzheimers disease (AD) exert only a short-lived effect on disease symptoms. Active and passive immunotherapy have both been shown to be effective in clearing plaques, removing Î_-amyloid (AÎ_) and improving behaviour in animal models of AD. Although the first active immunization trial in humans was discontinued because of severe adverse effects, several new approaches are currently being investigated in clinical trials. Recently, commercially available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have been used in small pilot trials for the treatment of patients with AD, based on the hypothesis that IVIG contains naturally occurring autoantibodies (nAbs-AÎ_) that specifically recognize and block the toxic effects of AÎ_. Furthermore, these nAbs-AÎ_ are reduced in AD patients compared with healthy controls, supporting the notion of replacement with IVIG. Beyond the occurrence of nAbs-AÎ_, evidence for several other mechanisms associated with IVIG in AD has been reported in preclinical experiments and clinical studies. In 2009, a phase III clinical trial involving more than 360 AD patients was initiated and may provide conclusive evidence for the effect of IVIG as a treatment option for AD in 2011.

The authors evaluated the available evidence for BZD effectiveness and tolerability for use in older adults in three psychiatric conditions for which BZDs are commonly prescribed: insomnia, anxiety disorders, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Design Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, were searched to identify articles that (1) included patients â‰¥50 years of age, (2) focused on patients diagnosed with insomnia, anxiety disorders, or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and (3) were either a randomized, placebo-controlled trial or a randomized trial comparing a BZD with either another psychotropic medication or psychotherapy. Results Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the three clinical indications evaluated, treatment of insomnia had the greatest available evidence for use of BZDs among older adults, with 21 of 25 trials demonstrating improved sleep outcomes with use of BZDs. Only one trial was found to meet eligibility criteria for BZD use in anxiety disorders, demonstrating benefit over placebo. Five studies for use in behavioral disturbances in dementia were included, of which only one demonstrated improvement over placebo. Conclusion This systematic review suggests that BZD prescribing to older adults is significantly in excess of what the available evidence suggests is appropriate. Future trials should focus on efforts to reduce both acute and chronic BZD use among older adults while improving access to effective non-pharmacologic treatment alternatives.",2018,,Harvard Review of Psychiatry,26,5,264-273,,10.1097/HRP.0000000000000190,,#444,Gerlach 2018

Subsequently, these appear to benefit those with lower baseline fatty acid levels, who are breastfeeding or who have neuropsychiatric conditions. Whilst multiple studies indicate that omega fatty acids can protect against neurodegeneration in older adults, more work is needed in the years preceding the diagnosis of such medical conditions.

Embase,What does the research say about androgen use and cerebrovascular events?,"Sadaie, M.R.; Farhoudi, M.; Zamanlu, M.; Aghamohammadzadeh, N.; Amouzegar, A.; Rosenbaum, R.E.; Thomas, G.A.","Many studies have investigated the benefits of androgen therapy and neurosteroids in aging men, while concerns remain about the potential associations of exogenous steroids and incidents of cerebrovascular events and ischemic stroke (IS). Testosterone is neuroprotective, neurotrophic and a potent stimulator of neuroplasticity. These benefits are mediated primarily through conversion of a small amount of testosterone to estradiol by the catalytic activity of estrogen synthetase (aromatase cytochrome P450 enzyme). New studies suggest that abnormal serum levels of the nonaromatized potent metabolite of testosterone, either high or low dihydrotestosterone (DHT), is a risk factor for stroke. Associations between pharmacologic androgen use and the incidence of IS are questionable, because a significant portion of testosterone is converted to DHT. There is also insufficient evidence to reject a causal relationship between the pro-testosterone adrenal androgens and incidence of IS. Moreover, vascular intima-media thickness, which is a predictor of stroke and myocardial symptoms, has correlations with sex hormones. Current diagnostic and treatment criteria for androgen therapy for cerebrovascular complications are unclear. Confounding variables, including genetic and metabolic alterations of the key enzymes of steroidogenesis, ought to be considered. Information extracted from pharmacogenetic testing may aid in expounding the protectiveâ€“destructive properties of neurosteroids, as well as the prognosis of androgen therapy, in particular their cerebrovascular outcomes.

Consequently, there is considerable research interest in understanding whether APOE-Îµ4 influences cognition in healthy adults. Despite a substantial literature reporting effects of APOE genotype on cognition, findings are inconsistent. In particular, it is challenging to separate whether cognitive deficits in APOE-Îµ4 carriers reflect the influence of prodromal dementia pathology (â€œprodromal hypothesisâ€ù), or a direct contribution of APOE genotype to individual differences (â€œphenotype hypothesisâ€ù). Variable methodology across studies further complicates the issue. These challenges have limited what can be learnt about the processes underlying cognitive ageing and dementia by studying the influence of APOE genotype on cognition. In this review, we focus on the two compatible neurobiological mechanisms by which APOE genotype may influence cognition in healthy adults (prodromal and phenotype). We summarise the behavioural evidence for the influence of APOE on cognition in non-demented adults and explore key methodological challenges for disentangling the cognitive effects of different neurobiological mechanisms of APOE. Evidence suggests that at least some APOE-Îµ4 cognitive deficits are due to early AD pathology, whilst sensitive measures of cognition are beginning to reveal subtle cognitive differences between APOE genotypes in mid-adulthood, prior to the onset of the AD prodromal period.

The normal aging dataset was divided into 3 age groups: young (20-40 years old), middle-aged (40-60 years old), and elderly (>60 years old). These datasets were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The Gene Ontology (GO) terms, pathways, and function network analysis of these DEGs were analyzed. Results: One thousand two hundred ninety-one DEGs were found to be shared in the natural aging groups and AD patients. Among the shared DEGs, ATP6V1E1, GNG3, NDUFV2, GOT1, USP14, and NAV2 have been previously found in both normal aging individuals and AD patients. Furthermore, using Java Enrichment of Pathways Extended to Topology (JEPETTO) analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, we determined that changes in aging-related KEGG annotations may contribute to the aging-dependence of AD risk. Interestingly, NRXN3, the second most commonly deregulated gene identified in the present study, is known to carry a mutation in AD patients. According to functional network analysis, NRXN3 plays a critical role in synaptic functions involved in the cognitive decline associated with normal aging and AD. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the low expression of aging-related NRXN3 may increase AD risk, though the potential mechanism requires further clarification.",2018,,Medicine (United States),97,28,,,10.1097/MD.0000000000011343,,#433,Zheng 2018

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched up to 31 December 2016, and the reference lists of relevant articles were also checked. Association between osteoporosis and AD was qualitatively analyzed, and BMD with AD was analyzed using a meta-analysis. Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) or hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The Q statistic and I2 methods were used to test for heterogeneity. We used subgroup analysis to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. Eight studies were included. Three provided data on osteoporosis and AD, and five reported BMD levels with AD. We performed two meta-analyses. The combined results indicated that AD patients had lower BMD compared with controls (SMD -1.23, 95% CI -1.93â€“0.54), and lower femoral neck BMD were associated with increased risk of AD after adjusting for confounding variables (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.67â€“2.88), respectively.

We performed a systematic review of the risk of overall cognitive impairment as an outcome in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Studies were identified through PubMedÂ®, MEDLINEÂ®, PsycINFOÂ®, Cochrane Library and Web of Knowledge/Scienceâ„¢. Articles were included if they 1) were published in English, 2) had subjects treated for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy, 3) incorporated longitudinal comparisons and 4) used control groups. In addition, prospective studies were required to assess an established cognitive related end point using International Cognition and Cancer Task Force criteria defining impaired cognitive performance as scoring 1.5 or more standard deviations below published norms on 2 or more tests, or scoring 2.0 or more standard deviations below published norms on at least 1 test. The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive impairment was pooled using a random effects model. Results: Of 221 abstracts 26 were selected for full text review, and 2 prospective and 4 retrospective studies were analyzed. Androgen deprivation therapy was not associated with overall cognitive impairment when the prospective cohort studies were pooled (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.92, p = 0.44) with significant heterogeneity between estimates (I2 = 83%). In retrospective data the relative risk of any cognitive impairment, including senile dementia and Alzheimer disease, was increased in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy, although the difference was not statistically significant (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.76, p = 0.13) with moderate heterogeneity between estimates (I2 = 67%). Conclusions: Analyses between overall cognitive impairment and use of androgen deprivation therapy defined according to International Cognition and Cancer Task Force criteria in a pooled analysis were inconclusive. In retrospective cohort studies the risk of overall cognitive impairment after androgen deprivation therapy was not significant. Better prospective studies need to be designed for the assessment of this end point.",2018,,Journal of Urology,199,6,1417-1425,,10.1016/j.juro.2017.11.136,,#431,Sun 2018

Ham. ex D.Don. (Family Zingiberaceae) is a rhizomatous herb, used in medicines, food, cosmetics and perfumery industries. Traditionally, it is widely used in treating inflammation, pain, asthma, foul breath, vomiting, diarrhoea, bronchitis, hiccough and blood diseases. This study systematically reviewed traditional and folk uses, pharmacological properties, bioactive compounds and market potential of H.Â spicatum. Research gaps and potential of future research have also been discussed. Key findings: Available literature indicates that research on this species is largely focused on phytochemical and pharmacological studies; however, propagation and modern interventions for high productivity have been contravened. These studies demonstrated that the rhizome of the species exhibited many valuable and medicinally important compounds, such as labdane terpenes, hedychinone and polyphenols. Many of the traditional uses of the species have been validated through the findings of pharmacological studies and biological properties of the extracts and pure compounds. Phytochemical constituents and related pharmacological activities have provided some suggestive scientific evidences for the various ethnomedicinal uses of the species in the treatment, control and management of diseases and for new drug discovery. Summary: Literature reveals that the species is lacking in exact scientific basis of the beneficial properties. Although, some other distinct biological properties identified in this species also opened new door way for its new applications. Therefore, the mentioned phytochemical constituents such as phenolic and flavonoids compounds; and related pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of the species have provided some suggestive scientific evidences for its potential in pharmaceutical, food and aromatic industries.",2018,,Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology,70,6,687-712,,10.1111/jphp.12890,,#430,Rawat 2018
Embase,Antipsychotic medication and type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose regulation,"Whicher, C.A.; Price, H.C.; Holt, R.I.G.","Objective: There have been concerns about the effects of antipsychotics on weight gain and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This article aims to provide an up-To-date review on the evidence addressing this issue and the practical implications for the management of people taking antipsychotics in the context of T2DM. Methods: We carried out searches on MEDLINE/PUBMED and the ClinicalTrials.gov website in August 2017 using the terms 'antipsychotic' and 'diabetes' or 'glucose' citing articles published after 2006 preferentially.Results: Antipsychotics are associated with T2DM and are likely to exert a causal effect of uncertain magnitude. Children and adolescents appear especially vulnerable to these metabolic effects; as T2DM is not common in healthy younger people, the relative risk is more apparent. Antipsychotics act on glucose and insulin homeostasis in a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms. To reduce the increasing health inequalities among individuals with mental illness screening, monitoring and prevention of T2DM is important, as is improved diabetes care in this population.Conclusion: It remains unclear whether these antipsychotic medications exacerbate an underlying predisposition to the development of T2DM or have a direct effect. Potential risks need to be weighed up and balanced between improved and lasting mental health benefits and any detrimental physical health side effects.

Embase,"Cinnamon, a promising prospect towards Alzheimer's disease","Momtaz, S.; Hassani, S.; Khan, F.; Ziaee, M.; Abdollahi, M.","Over the last decades, an exponential increase of efforts concerning the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been practiced. Phytochemicals preparations have a millenary background to combat various pathological conditions. Various cinnamon species and their biologically active ingredients have renewed the interest towards the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD through the inhibition of tau protein aggregation and prevention of the formation and accumulation of amyloid-Î_ peptides into the neurotoxic oligomeric inclusions, both of which are considered to be the AD trademarks. In this review, we presented comprehensive data on the interactions of a number of cinnamon polyphenols (PPs) with oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in the brain. In addition, we discussed the potential association between AD and diabetes mellitus (DM), vis-Ã -vis the effluence of cinnamon PPs. Further, an upcoming prospect of AD epigenetic pathophysiological conditions and cinnamon has been sighted. Data was retrieved from the scientific databases such as PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine, Scopus and Google Scholar without any time limitation. The extract of cinnamon efficiently inhibits tau accumulations, AÎ_ aggregation and toxicity in vivo and in vitro models. Indeed, cinnamon possesses neuroprotective effects interfering multiple oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory pathways. Besides, cinnamon modulates endothelial functions and attenuates the vascular cell adhesion molecules. Cinnamon PPs may induce AD epigenetic modifications. Cinnamon and in particular, cinnamaldehyde seem to be effective and safe approaches for treatment and prevention of AD onset and/or progression.

Nevertheless, characteristics relating to socioeconomic status (SES) are poorly described in research reports. The aim of the present review was to verify whether the SES of participants is adequately reported in interventional studies targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to explore the impact of SES proxy measures on the efficacy of the considered medications. Methods: A systematic review of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the currently marketed drugs for AD (i.e. cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) was conducted by performing a structured search on PubMed and the Cochrane databases. The following indicators of SES were considered in the retained studies: (i) educational level, (ii) lifetime job category, (iii) income and (iv) wealth. The study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials. Results: A total of 48 articles were finally selected. Overall, only eight RCTs reported data concerning the four considered SES indicators. Indeed, only information pertaining to the educational level of participants was provided. Only one RCT (n = 60) performed ad hoc, secondary analyses accounting for the SES of participating subjects. Conclusions: The research and clinical relevance of SES has mistakenly been overlooked by the vast majority of RCTs on AD. A greater effort should be made to collect and report data on those SES indicators that may significantly affect the clinical manifestations and trajectories of patients with cognitive disturbances.",2018,,European Journal of Neurology,25,4,626-e43,,10.1111/ene.13587,,#423,Canevelli 2018
Embase,Efficacy of curcumin for age-associated cognitive decline: a narrative review of preclinical and clinical studies,"Sarker, M.R.; Franks, S.F.","Processes such as aberrant redox signaling and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation have been reported to modulate age-associated pathologies such as cognitive impairment. Curcumin, the primary therapeutic component of the Indian spice, Turmeric (Curcuma longa), has long been known for its strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity attributable to its unique molecular structure. Recently, an interest in this polyphenol as a cognitive therapeutic for the elderly has emerged. The purpose of this paper is to critically review preclinical and clinical studies that have evaluated the efficacy of curcumin in ameliorating and preventing age-associated cognitive decline and address the translational progress of preclinical to clinical efficacy. PubMed, semantic scholar, and Google scholar searches were used for preclinical studies; and clinicaltrials.gov, the Australian and New Zealand clinical trials registry, and PubMed search were used to select relevant completed clinical studies. Results from preclinical studies consistently demonstrate curcumin and its analogues to be efficacious for various aspects of cognitive impairment and processes that contribute to age-associated cognitive impairment. Results of published clinical studies, while mixed, continue to show promise for curcuminâ€™s use as a therapeutic for cognitive decline but overall remain inconclusive at this time. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have found that curcumin can significantly decrease oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and obstruct pathways that activate transcription factors that augment these processes. Future clinical studies would benefit from including evaluation of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of dementia and behavioral markers of cognitive decline, as well as targeting the appropriate population.",2018,,GeroScience,40,2,73-95,,10.1007/s11357-018-0017-z,,#421,Sarker 2018
Embase,Is physical activity a potential preventive factor for vascular dementia? A systematic review.,"Aarsland, D.; Sardahaee, F.S.; Anderssen, S.; Ballard, C.; Alzheimer's Society Systematic Review group,","BACKGROUND: Physical exercise has several beneficial effects, including reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. Although several studies of potential risk factors for vascular dementia (VaD) exist, including physical activity, the studies have usually included few participants and there are no meta-analyses addressing this key topic. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched using the key words 'physical exercise' 'activity' or 'walking' in combination with 'dementia' and 'vascular dementia'. Potentially relevant studies were assessed and summarised by two of the authors, and longitudinal studies with operationalized definition of physical activity providing risk for VaD in both groups were included in the meta-analysis using pooled estimates from a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 24 longitudinal studies, including 1378 patients with VaD, were included in the review. The majority of individual studies did not report significant associations. Five studies fulfilled criteria for meta-analysis, including 10,108 non-demented control subjects and 374 individuals with VaD. The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association between physical exercise and a reduced risk of developing VaD: OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.42-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is evidence supporting the hypothesis that physical activity is likely to prevent the development of VaD, and should be highlighted as part of secondary prevention programmes in people at risk for cerebrovascular disease.",2010,,Aging & mental health,14,4,386-395,,10.1080/13607860903586136,,#245,Aarsland 2010
Embase,Factors associated with prolonged delirium: A systematic review,"Dasgupta, M.; Hillier, L.M.","Background: Delirium frequently accompanies acute illness. With treatment of the illness, some individuals recover from delirium while for others the symptoms persist. It is not understood why some individuals improve but others do not. The purpose of this paper is to review systematically what is known about the factors associated with the persistence of delirium. Methods: A medical literature search was conducted using several bibliographic databases, supplemented by manual searches of the references. English or French studies were included if they compared two groups of delirious individuals in delirium duration or persistence up to six months after the onset of delirium, diagnosed prospectively with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria (or a scale derived and validated against the DSM). Information was collected on the association between possible non-therapeutic prognostic variables and delirium persistence. Results: Twenty-one observational studies were included, in various settings (e.g. mixed medical-surgical, medical or geriatric, surgical, psychiatric, cancer or palliative care units). Variables assessed included patient characteristics (e.g. age, dementia, medical comorbidity, functional status), delirium characteristics (e.g. presence of hypoactive symptoms, delirium severity) and illness characteristics (e.g. severity of illness, and underlying acute illness). Overall, studies suggested that delirium is often persistent at discharge or beyond. Persistence was associated with dementia, increasing numbers of medical conditions, increasing severity of delirium, hypoactive symptoms and hypoxic illnesses. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that some factors may identify those at risk for persistent delirium; however, more research is needed.

Embase,Cerebrovascular accidents in elderly people treated with antipsychotic drugs: A systematic review,"Sacchetti, E.; Turrina, C.; Valsecchi, P.","After 2002, an association between stroke and antipsychotic use was reported in clinical trials and large database studies. This review considers previous quantitative reviews, newly published clinical trials, and recent observational cohort and case-control studies, and focuses on the clinical significance of the risk for stroke, the difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics, the possible at-risk patient profile and the timing of stroke after exposure. A search of MEDLINE covering the period from 1966 to June 2009 was carried out using selected keywords. Inclusion criteria were (i) quantitative reviews on stroke and antipsychotics; (ii) double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving patients with dementia treated with antipsychotics; and (iii) observational database cohort studies and observational case-control studies investigating the association between stroke and antipsychotics. Clinical trials were excluded if they were single-blind or if patients were affected by dementia andor other neurological illnesses.Four reviews with aggregate data, 2 meta-analyses, 13 randomized, double-blind, controlled trials, 7 observational cohort studies and 4 observational case-control studies were selected and analysed. The incidence of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) was found to be very low in aggregate reviews and meta-analyses (24). When the number collected was sufficiently high, or different drug treatments were grouped together, the higher rate in subjects exposed to antipsychotics was statistically significant. Inspection of other randomized controlled clinical trials, not included in aggregate reviews and meta-analyses, reported similar rates of CVAs. The majority of observational cohort studies compared typical and atypical antipsychotics and no significant class differences were found. A comparison with non-users was carried out in some cohort studies. In case-control studies, the probability of CVAs in users compared with non-users was in the range of 1.3-to 2-fold greater. Preliminary data also indicate that the highest risk of stroke is related to the first weeks of treatment, and a risk profile for stroke is emerging, such as older age, cognitive impairment and vascular illness. Different pathophysiological pathways may be involved, ranging from the facilitation of thrombosis, pre-existing cardiovascular factors, sedation and a common diathesis for stroke of dementia, schizophrenia and affective illness.Before prescribing an antipsychotic, clinicians should weigh all the risk factors for a given patient and consider not only the indications as provided by the regulatory agencies, but also the overall effectiveness of typical and atypical antipsychotics.

This study reviews recent work on the incidence of MCI in the elderly. Methods: Incidence papers were identified by a systematic literature search. Studies on the incidence of MCI were considered if they identified 'cognitively mildly impaired' subjects by application of the MCI criteria, used the 'person-years-at-risk' method, and were based on population- or community-based samples. Results: Nine studies were identified. The incidence of amnestic MCI subtypes ranged between 9.9 and 40.6 per 1,000 person-years, and the incidence of non-amnestic MCI subtypes was 28 and 36.3 per 1,000 person-years. Regarding any MCI, incidence rates of 51 and 76.8 per 1,000 person-years were found. A higher risk of incident MCI mainly resulted for higher age, lower education and hypertension. Discussion: The incidence rates of MCI varied widely, and possible risk factors for incident MCI were analysed only to a limited extent. The findings call for an agreement concerning the criteria used for MCI and the operationalisation of these criteria. Copyright Â© 2010 S.

Embase,Does highly active antiretroviral therapy improve neurocognitive function? A systematic review,"Joska, J.A.; Gouse, H.; Paul, R.H.; Stein, D.J.; Flisher, A.J.","Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dementia (HAD), whereas the overall prevalence appears to have increased. Recent changes to diagnostic nosology have emphasized the presence of neurocognitive deficits. Uniform methods of ascertaining neuropsychological impairment and excluding confounding causes are critical to between-study comparison. We conducted a systematic review on all studies that use single-cohort prospective treatment effect design that reported on the neurocognitive or neuropsychological profile of individuals commencing HAART. Fifteen 15 relevant studies were included. A large number of studies using observational or cross-sectional designs were excluded, as these do not allow for a within-subject description of pre-and post-HAART predictive factors. Eleven studies reported a significant improvement in neurocognitive status or neuropsychological profile over an average study period of 6 months. Variable or nonreporting of HAART regimens in these studies did not allow for an analysis of individual agent or regimen effectiveness. The results show that although HAART does improve cognition, it does not appear to fully eradicate impairments. The methods used in this research differ widely and therefore comparison across studies is difficult. Studies examining the long-term effects of HAART on HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) using uniform methods of data collection are needed, together with clear reporting of HAART regimens.

Embase,Exploring new indications for statins beyond atherosclerosis: Successes and setbacks,"Waters, D.D.","Statins have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events across a broad spectrum of patients at risk, irrespective of baseline LDL-cholesterol levels. In a meta-analysis of 14 statin trials involving more than 90,000 participants, statin therapy reduced the 5-year incidence of cardiovascular events by about 20% for each mmol/L of LDL-cholesterol reduction. The results of the Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese (MEGA) study suggest that the degree of reduction in Japanese subjects may be greater than this for the same degree of LDL-cholesterol reduction. Given the success of statins in preventing cardiovascular events, it is not surprising that they have been tested in a variety of related conditions, three of which are discussed in this article. Heart failure is characterized by inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and neurohumeral activation, conditions that are ameliorated by statin therapy. The Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) showed no significant benefit of rosuvastatin upon the primary endpoint, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke. However, subgroups identified by the biomarkers plasma amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic and C-reactive protein showed a reduction in events. Aortic stenosis and atherosclerosis share common risk factors, including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Although non-randomized cohort studies have suggested that statins slow the progression of aortic stenosis, this was not shown in either of the two randomized placebo-controlled trials testing this hypothesis. Similarly, Alzheimer's disease shares many risk factors with atherosclerosis, and several observational studies have reported a lower risk of developing this condition in patients taking statins. However, two recently completed clinical trials indicate that neither atorvastatin nor simvastatin slow the progression of early Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, although statins are effective, established therapy for the prevention of vascular events in patients at risk, they have as yet not proven to be successful for these newer indications.

Scopus, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and HuGE databases were searched up to November 2008. Two independent reviewers selected 94 articles from 13,122 results. Results suggest the deleterious effect of current smoking is limited only to persons without ApoE Îµ4 (4 out of 4 studies), ApoE Îµ4 increases the risk of dementia associated with greater fat consumption, particularly saturated fats (3 out of 4 studies), and increases the protective effect against dementia associated with HRT use (3 out of 5 with one of the non-significant studies suggesting a trend). There was evidence that ApoE does not modify the risk of dementia associated with measures of, and treatments for CVD, other dietary factors, and estradiol levels. There was inconsistent or contradictory evidence for other environmental factors reviewed.

Arimoclomol (BRX-220), being developed by CytRx Corp, is an oral therapeutic candidate for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease. ALS is a fatal, incurable disorder, which can present as sporadic (90 to 95% of cases) or familial (5 to 10% of cases) forms. The etiology of sporadic ALS remains unknown and much of the understanding of ALS pathogenesis has been derived through study of its familial forms; in particular, through study of autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase) gene, which cause approximately 20% of familial ALS cases. Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival, even after symptom onset. Clinical trials have reported good tolerability and safety. This paper discusses the rationale for arimoclomol use in ALS, the preclinical and clinical evidence collected to date, the likelihood of its promising preclinical results translating to humans, and the relevance of this research for neurodegeneration as a whole.

Embase,Effectiveness of the mediterranean diet: Can it help delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease?,"Sofi, F.; Macchi, C.; Abbate, R.; Gensini, G.F.; Casini, A.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive and memory deterioration, with an increasing prevalence in the industrialized countries and an extraordinary cost of caring for patients. Due to the limited information available on the exact pathophysiology of the disease, over the last years there have been extensive efforts on the identification of possible risk factors, but no conclusive data have been obtained. Some risk factors have been identified but no clear evidence on what is clearly associated with the occurrence and progression of AD are available, and in particular no effective preventive strategies have been found. One of the most intriguing and appealing lines of investigation is the association between lifestyle habits such as diet and dietary compounds and the occurrence of AD. In this review, we focus on studies that investigated the association between nutrition and AD, paying particular attention to the role of a dietary pattern such as a Mediterranean-like diet on the occurrence of such disease. Studies in support of Mediterranean diet as an optimal diet for prevention of cardiovascular and major chronic diseases has rapidly evolved. A recent meta-analysis from our group, comprising prospective studies that investigated the association between adherence to Mediterranean diet and health status, showed a significant association between a greater adherence to Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of major chronic degenerative diseases, including AD. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet has been extensively reported to be associated with a favorable health outcome and a better quality of life.

Embase,B-vitamins and fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia: A systematic review,"Dangour, A.D.; Whitehouse, P.J.; Rafferty, K.; Mitchell, S.A.; Smith, L.; Hawkesworth, S.; Vellas, B.","The increasing worldwide prevalence of dementia is a major public health concern. Findings from some epidemiological studies suggest that diet and nutrition may be important modifiable risk factors for development of dementia. In order to evaluate the strength of the available evidence of an association of dietary factors with dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD), we systematically searched relevant publication databases and hand-searched bibliographies up to end July 2007. We included prospective cohort studies which evaluated the association of nutrient levels with the risk of developing dementia and randomized intervention studies examining the treatment effect of nutrient supplementation on cognitive function. One hundred and sixty studies, comprising ninety one prospective cohort studies and sixty nine intervention studies, met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Of these, thirty-three studies (19 cohort and 14 randomized controlled trials) investigated the effects of folate, B-vitamins, and levels of homocysteine (a biomarker modifiable through B-vitamin supplementation) or fish/fatty acids and are the focus of the present report. Some observational cohort studies indicated that higher dietary intake or elevated serum levels of folate and fish/fatty acids and low serum levels of homocysteine were associated with a reduced risk of incident AD and dementia, while other studies reported no association. The results of intervention studies examining the effects of folic acid or fatty acid supplementation on cognitive function are inconsistent. In summary, the available evidence is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions on the association of B vitamins and fatty acids with cognitive decline or dementia, and further long-term trials are required.

Embase,Systematic review of health behavioral risks and cognitive health in older adults,"Lee, Y.; Back, J.H.; Kim, J.; Kim, S.-H.; Na, D.L.; Cheong, H.-K.; Hong, C.H.; Kim, Y.G.","Background: An increasing body of evidence suggests that health behaviors may protect against cognitive impairment and dementia. The purpose of this study was to summarize the current evidence on health behavioral factors predicting cognitive health through a systematic review of the published literature. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies on community representative samples aged 65 and older, with prospective cohort design and multivariate analysis. The outcome - cognitive health - was defined as a continuum of cognitive function ranging from cognitive decline to impairment and dementia, and health behaviors included physical activity, smoking, alcohol drinking, body mass index, and diet and nutrition. Results: Of 12,105 abstracts identified, 690 relevant full-texts were reviewed. The final yield amounted to 115 articles of which 37 studies were chosen that met the highest standards of quality. Leisure time physical activity, even of moderate level, showed protective effects against dementia, whereas smoking elevated the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Moderate alcohol consumption tended to be protective against cognitive decline and dementia, but nondrinkers and frequent drinkers exhibited a higher risk for dementia and cognitive impairment. Midlife obesity had an adverse effect on cognitive function in later life. Analysis showed vegetable and fish consumption to be of benefit, whereas, persons consuming a diet high in saturated fat had an increased dementia risk. Conclusion: The review demonstrates accumulating evidence supporting health behavioral effects in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Results indicate potential benefits of healthy lifestyles in protecting cognitive health in later life.

Embase,Sex steroids to maintain cognitive function in women after the menopause: A meta-analyses of treatment trials,"Hogervorst, E.; Bandelow, S.","It is still debated whether estrogen treatment after the menopause could result in improved cognitive function in women. This debate is based on many animal and cell culture data showing that estrogens can positively affect the aging brain. Observational data also show a halved risk of dementia in women who took estrogens around the age of menopause. However, large treatment trials have shown negative effects of long-term treatment with estrogens in older women. The present meta-analyses included 36 randomised treatment trials and tested various hypotheses which have been developed to attempt to explain discrepant data. Results indicated that, contrary to expectations, age of women and duration of time elapsed when treatment was initiated since menopause ('window of opportunity' hypothesis) did not significantly affect treatment outcome, nor did it matter whether women were symptomatic or not. It was not clear whether bilateral oophorectomy affected the outcome, as this effect was based on only a few studies from the same group and some observational studies show negative effects on cognition in surgical menopausal women treated with hormones for more than 10 years. Duration of treatment overall significantly affected outcome. More negative effects were seen in longer studies, where positive effects were mainly seen in short term studies (<4 months). Treatment with combined estrogens and progestagens also negatively affected the outcome. Whether women with symptoms should be treated for a couple of months or using other (intermittent) modes of treatment and whether this could have long-term positive consequences remains to be investigated.

Embase,The physical and psychological effects of HIV infection and its treatment on perinatally HIV-infected children,"Vreeman, R.C.; Scanlon, M.L.; McHenry, M.S.; Nyandiko, W.M.","Introduction: As highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) transforms human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into a manageable chronic disease, new challenges are emerging in treating children born with HIV, including a number of risks to their physical and psychological health due to HIV infection and its lifelong treatment. Methods: We conducted a literature review to evaluate the evidence on the physical and psychological effects of perinatal HIV (PHIV+) infection and its treatment in the era of HAART, including major chronic comorbidities. Results and discussion: Perinatally infected children face concerning levels of treatment failure and drug resistance, which may hamper their long-term treatment and result in more significant comorbidities. Physical complications from PHIV+ infection and treatment potentially affect all major organ systems. Although treatment with antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has reduced incidence of severe neurocognitive diseases like HIV encephalopathy, perinatally infected children may experience less severe neurocognitive complications related to HIV disease and ARV neurotoxicity. Major metabolic complications include dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, complications that are associated with both HIV infection and several ARV agents and may significantly affect cardiovascular disease risk with age. Bone abnormalities, particularly amongst children treated with tenofovir, are a concern for perinatally infected children who may be at higher risk for bone fractures and osteoporosis. In many studies, rates of anaemia are significantly higher for HIV-infected children. Renal failure is a significant complication and cause of death amongst perinatally infected children, while new data on sexual and reproductive health suggest that sexually transmitted infections and birth complications may be additional concerns for perinatally infected children in adolescence. Finally, perinatally infected children may face psychological challenges, including higher rates of mental health and behavioural disorders. Existing studies have significant methodological limitations, including small sample sizes, inappropriate control groups and heterogeneous definitions, to name a few. Conclusions: Success in treating perinatally HIV-infected children and better understanding of the physical and psychological implications of lifelong HIV infection require that we address a new set of challenges for children. A better understanding of these challenges will guide care providers, researchers and policymakers towards more effective HIV care management for perinatally infected children and their transition to adulthood.",2015,,Journal of the International AIDS Society,18,"(Vreeman R.C., rvreeman@iu.edu; Scanlon M.L.; McHenry M.S.)

We report a review of case reports on these subjects. Methods We undertook a literature search on MEDLINE, PsychInfo and EMBASE to identify case reports of first episode of mania or hypomania presenting over the age of 50. Results 35 cases were identified. 29/35 (82%) had a suspected underlying organic cause. Organic causes included vascular causes, iatrogenic drug use, electrolyte imbalance, dementia and thyroid disease. Vascular risk factors were present in 17/35 cases (48%). In 10/35 (28%) of cases organic treatment contributed to successful remission of the manic episode. Limitations As evidently not all cases have been reported the main limitation is that of publication bias for this paper. Any such hypothesis generated from studying these cases would require replication in prospective longitudinal trials of this cohort of patients. Conclusions This review of case reports appears to add to evidence of late onset mania having an organic basis. Whether this is a separate organic syndrome remains to be established.

Embase,The role of radiotherapy in the management of patients with diffuse low grade glioma: A systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline,"Ryken, T.C.; Parney, I.; Buatti, J.; Kalkanis, S.N.; Olson, J.J.","Questions: 1.What is the optimal role of external beam radiotherapy in the management of adult patients with newly diagnosed low-grade glioma (LGG) in terms of improving outcome (i.e. survival, complications, seizure control or other reported outcomes of interest)?2.Which radiation strategies (dose, timing, fractionation, stereotactic radiation, brachytherapy, chemotherapy) improve outcomes compared to standard external beam radiation therapy in the initial management of low grade gliomas in adults?3.Do specific factors (e.g. age, volume, extent of resection, genetic subtype) identify subgroups with better outcomes following radiation therapy than the general population of adults with newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas? Target population: These recommendations apply to adults with newly diagnosed diffuse LGG. Recommendations: Outcomes in adult patients with newly diagnosed low grade glioma treated with radiotherapy: Level I Radiotherapy is recommended in the management of newly diagnosed low-grade glioma in adults to prolong progression free survival, irrespective of extent of resection. Level II Radiotherapy is recommended in the management of newly diagnosed low grade glioma in adults as an equivalent alternative to observation in preserving cognitive function, irrespective of extent of resection. Level III Radiotherapy is recommended in the management of newly diagnosed low grade glioma in adults to improve seizure control in patients with epilepsy and subtotal resection. Level III Radiotherapy is recommended in the management of newly diagnosed low-grade glioma in adults to prolong overall survival in patients with subtotal resection. Level III Consideration of the risk of radiation induced morbidity, including cognitive decline, imaging abnormalities, metabolic dysfunction and malignant transformation, is recommended when the delivery of radiotherapy is selected in the management of newly diagnosed low-grade glioma in adults. Strategies of radiotherapy in adult patients with newly diagnosed low grade glioma: Level I Lower dose radiotherapy is recommended as an equivalent alternative to higher dose immediate postoperative radiotherapy (45â€“50.4 vs. 59.4â€“64.8Â Gy) in the management of newly diagnosed low-grade glioma in adults with reduced toxicity. Level III Delaying radiotherapy until recurrence or progression is recommended as an equivalent alternative to immediate postoperative radiotherapy in the management of newly diagnosed low-grade glioma in adults but may result in shorter time to progression. Level III The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy is not recommended over whole brain radiotherapy alone in the management of low-grade glioma, as it provides no additional survival benefit. Level III Limited-field radiotherapy is recommended over whole brain radiotherapy in the management of low-grade glioma. Level III Either stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy are recommended as acceptable alternatives to external radiotherapy in selected patients. Prognostic factors in adult patients with newly diagnosed low grade glioma treated with radiotherapy: Level II It is recommended that age greater than 40Â years, astrocytic pathology, diameter greater than 6Â cm, tumor crossing the midline and preoperative neurological deficit be considered as negative prognostic indicators when predicting overall survival in adult low grade glioma patients treated with radiotherapy. Level II It is recommended that smaller tumor size, extent of surgical resection and higher mini-mental status exam be considered as positive prognostic indicators when predicting overall survival and progression free survival in patients in adult low grade glioma patients treated with radiotherapy. Level III It is recommended that seizures at presentation, presence of oligodendroglial histological component and 1p19q deletion (along with additional relevant factorsâ€”see TableÂ 1) be considered as positive prognostic indicators when predicting response to radiotherapy in adults with low grade gliomas. Level III It is recommended that increasing age, decreasing performance status, decreasing cognition, presence of astrocytic histological component (along with additional relevant factors (see TablesÂ 1, 2) be considered as negative prognostic indicators when predicting response to radiotherapy.",2015,,Journal of Neuro-Oncology,125,3,551-583,,10.1007/s11060-015-1948-1,,#228,Ryken 2015
Embase,Medications associated with falls in older people: Systematic review of publications from a recent 5-year period,"Park, H.; Satoh, H.; Miki, A.; Urushihara, H.; Sawada, Y.","Purpose: Falls are an important public health problem in older people. Medication use is considered a risk factor for falls. This study systematically reviewed recent studies to determine the medications that might be associated with the risk of falling in older people. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of prospective and retrospective studies identified through the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases that quantitatively assessed the contribution of medications to falls risk in participants â‰¥60 years old published in English between May 2008 and April 2013. Results: The search identified 1,895 articles; 36 articles met the inclusion criteria. Of the 19 studies that investigated the effect of polypharmacy on the risk of falling, six studies reported that the risk of falling increased with polypharmacy. Data on the use of antihypertensive medications including calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and angiotensin system blocking medications were collected in 14 studies, with mixed results. Twenty-nine studies reported an association between the risk of falls and psychotropic medications including sedatives and hypnotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines. Conclusions: The use of sedatives and hypnotics and antidepressants including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors appears to be related with an increased risk of falls.

Embase,Neuroinflammation in Lewy body dementia,"Surendranathan, A.; Rowe, J.B.; O'Brien, J.T.","Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions. However, it remains unclear whether it has a protective or damaging role. Studies of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease have provided much of the evidence for inflammatory pathology in neurodegeneration. Here we review the evidence for inflammation in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Neuroinflammation has been confirmed in vivo using PET imaging, with microglial activation seen in Parkinson's disease dementia and recently in dementia with Lewy bodies. In Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia, microglial activation suggests a chronic inflammatory process, although there is also evidence of its association with cognitive ability and neuronal function.Alpha-synuclein in various conformations has also been linked to activation of microglia, with a broad range of components of the innate and adaptive immune systems associated with this interaction.Evidence of neuroinflammation in Lewy body dementia is further supported by pathological and biomarker studies. Genetic and epidemiological studies support a role for inflammation in Parkinson's disease, but have yet to provide the same for Lewy body dementia.This review highlights the need to identify whether the nature and extent of microglial activation in Lewy body dementia can be linked to structural change, progression of domain specific cognitive symptoms and peripheral inflammation as a marker of central microglial pathology. Answers to these questions will enable the evaluation of immunotherapies as potential therapeutic options for prevention or treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia.",2015,,Parkinsonism and Related Disorders,21,12,1398-1406,,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2015.10.009,,#226,Surendranathan 2015
Embase,Cysteine proteases as therapeutic targets: Does selectivity matter?

In neurodegenerative disorders, multiple cysteine proteases provide targets for enzyme inhibitors, notably caspases, calpains, and cathepsins. The reactive, active-site cysteine provides specificity for many inhibitor designs over other families of proteases, such as aspartate and serine; however, a) inhibitor strategies often use covalent enzyme modification, and b) obtaining selectivity within families of cysteine proteases and their isozymes is problematic. This review provides a general update on strategies for cysteine protease inhibitor design and a focus on cathepsin B and calpain 1 as drug targets for neurodegenerative disorders; the latter focus providing an interesting query for the contemporary assumptions that irreversible, covalent protein modification and low selectivity are anathema to therapeutic safety and efficacy.",2015,,Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B,5,6,506-519,,10.1016/j.apsb.2015.08.001,,#225,Siklos 2015

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the possible effect of sHT on cognitive decline and the risk of dementia. Methods: Cognitive function was the primary outcome, evaluated as composite endpoint of incidence or prevalence of dementia or difference of Mini Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised scores. Results: Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. A significant risk of cognitive alteration was observed only in sHT individuals younger than age 75 years: composite endpoint odds ratio (OR) 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-2.27, P = .02, I2 = 82.5%), risk of dementia OR 1.81 (95% CI 1.43-2.28, P < .01, I2 = 35%). Mean serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and the OR of composite endpoint were positively correlated. No significant effect of sHT was found when considering all the studies as a whole: composite endpoint OR 1.26 (95% CI 0.96-1.66, P=.09, I2=87.2%), risk of dementia OR 1.42 (95% CI, 0.97-2.07, P=.07, I2=66.8%), Mini Mental State Examination mean difference-0.059 (95% CI-0.464 to 0.346 P = .78, I2 = 51.8%). Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates a relationship between sHT and cognitive impairment only in individuals younger than 75 years of age and those with higher TSH concentrations. No correlation was found while considering all the studies as a whole. The lack of utilization of age-related serum TSH reference ranges and consequent potential misdiagnosis of sHT in older people may account for this.",2015,,Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,100,11,4240-4248,,10.1210/jc.2015-2046,,#224,Pasqualetti 2015

AD is histologically characterized by accumulation of amyloid-Î_ protein (AÎ_) on extracellular plaques and deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Several studies have shown that obesity may precede dementia and that lifestyle factors play a critical role in the onset of AD. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that obesity is an independent risk factor for developing AD. In this scenario, the understanding of the role of adipose tissue in brain health is essential to clarify the establishment of demential processes. The objective of this work was to review studies regarding leptin, an anorexigenic peptide hormone synthesized in adipocytes, in the context of dementia. Some authors proposed that leptin evaluation might be a better predictor of dementia than traditional anthropometric measures. Leptin, once established as a biomarker, could enhance the understanding of late-onset AD risk over the life course, as well as the clinical progression of prodromal state to manifested AD.

Embase,Diffusion imaging changes in grey matter in Alzheimer's disease: A potential marker of early neurodegeneration,"Weston, P.S.J.; Simpson, I.J.A.; Ryan, N.S.; Ourselin, S.; Fox, N.C.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is recognized to have a long presymptomatic period, during which there is progressive accumulation of molecular pathology, followed by inexorable neuronal damage. The ability to identify presymptomatic individuals with evidence of neurodegenerative change, to stage their disease, and to track progressive changes will be important for early diagnosis and for prevention trials. Despite recent advances, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging, our ability to identify early neurodegenerative changes reliably is limited. The development of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, which is sensitive to microstructural changes not visible with conventional volumetric techniques, has led to a number of diffusion imaging studies in AD; these have largely focused on white matter changes. However, in AD cerebral grey matter is affected very early, with pathological studies suggesting that grey matter changes predate those in white matter. In this article we review the growing number of studies that assess grey matter diffusivity changes in AD. Although use of the technique is still at a relatively early stage, results so far have been promising. Initial studies identified changes in diffusion measures in the hippocampi of patients with mild cognitive impairment, which predated macroscopic volume loss, with positive predictive value for progression to AD dementia. More recent studies have identified abnormalities in multiple neocortical areas (particularly the posterior cingulate) at various stages of disease progression. Studies of patients who carry genetic mutations predisposing to autosomal dominant familial AD have shown cortical and subcortical grey matter diffusivity changes several years before the expected onset of the first clinical symptoms. The technique is not without potential methodological difficulties, especially relating to partial volume effects, although recent advances appear to be reducing such issues. Going forward, further utilization of grey matter diffusion measurements in AD may improve our understanding with regards to the timing and nature of the earliest presymptomatic neurodegenerative changes. This imaging technique may also be useful in comparing and contrasting subtle variations in different disease subgroups, and as a sensitive outcome measure for presymptomatic clinical trials in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",2015,,Alzheimer's Research and Therapy,7,1,,,10.1186/s13195-015-0132-3,,#215,Weston 2015
Embase,Pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in the elderly,"Ford, A.H.; Almeida, O.P.","Delirium is a common occurrence in older hospitalised patients, particularly in the setting of surgical intervention and acute illness. Delirium is associated with a number of adverse clinical and social outcomes with higher financial cost and risk of developing dementia, as well as increased likelihood of need for residential care. Current interventions for the prevention of delirium typically involve recognition and amelioration of modifiable risk factors and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose the individual to delirium. A number of pharmacological strategies for delirium prevention have been tested. Antipsychotic medications are used for treatment of agitation in the setting of delirium when other measures have failed, but their efficacy in prevention is limited by study heterogeneity and concerns about tolerability. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease but do not appear to be effective in preventing delirium. Melatonin and melatonin agonists have a rather benign side effect profile and show promise for prevention of delirium in medically unwell individuals. The alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine may be helpful in the intensive care unit setting but intravenous route of administration and need for close clinical supervision limits its use in the wider hospital environment. Other agents such as benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, statins and gabapentin have been suggested but lack evidence to support their role in delirium prevention. To date, there is inconsistent and conflicting data regarding the efficacy of any particular pharmacological agent although some interventions do show promise. Larger, well-designed, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed.",2015,,Maturitas,81,2,287-292,,10.1016/j.maturitas.2015.03.024,,#213,Ford 2015

One study compared melatonin to midazolam, clonidine, and control groups for the prevention and management of delirium in individuals who were pre- and posthip post-hip arthroplasty. The other study compared melatonin to placebo for the prevention of delirium in older adults admitted to an inpatient internal medicine service. Data from these 2 studies indicate that melatonin may have some benefit in the prevention and management of delirium in older adults. However, there is no evidence that melatonin reduces the severity of delirium or has any effect on behaviors or functions in these individuals. Melatonin was well tolerated in these 2 studies.

APOE4 is the greatest AD-genetic risk factor; increasing risk up to 12-fold compared to APOE3, with APOE4-specific neuroinflammation an important component of this risk. This editorial review discusses the role of APOE in inflammation and AD, via a literature review, presentation of novel data on AÎ_-induced neuroinflammation, and discussion of future research directions. The complexity of chronic neuroinflammation, including multiple detrimental and beneficial effects occurring in a temporal and cell-specific manner, has resulted in conflicting functional data for virtually every inflammatory mediator. Defining a neuroinflammatory phenotype (NIP) is one way to address this issue, focusing on profiling the changes in inflammatory mediator expression during disease progression. Although many studies have shown that APOE4 induces a detrimental NIP in peripheral inflammation and AÎ_-independent neuroinflammation, data for APOE-modulated AÎ_-induced neuroinflammation are surprisingly limited. We present data supporting the hypothesis that impaired apoE4 function modulates AÎ_-induced effects on inflammatory receptor signaling, including amplification of detrimental (toll-like receptor 4-p38Î±) and suppression of beneficial (IL-4R-nuclear receptor) pathways. To ultimately develop APOE genotype-specific therapeutics, it is critical that future studies define the dynamic NIP profile and pathways that underlie APOE-modulated chronic neuroinflammation.",2015,,Journal of Neurochemistry,133,4,465-488,,10.1111/jnc.13072,,#209,Tai 2015

Method: Peer-reviewed articles (randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and quasi-experimental trials) published in English between January 2000 and February 2014, retrieved from six electronic databases â€“ Medline (ProQuest), CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE and Scopus â€“ according to predefned inclusion criteria were included. Where possible, results were pooled and meta-analysis was conducted. Results: Four articles (three RCT and one single-group pre- and post-test pilot study) were included. The study quality of the three RCTs was high; however, measurement outcomes, interventions, and follow-up time periods differed across studies. On completion of the intervention period, the mean number of falls was lower in the exercise group compared to the control group (mean difference [MD] [95% confidence interval {CI}] =-1.06 [-1.67 to -0.46] falls). Importantly, the exercise intervention reduced the risk of being a faller by 32% (risk ratio [95% CI] =0.68 [0.55â€“0.85]). Only two other outcomes were reported in two or more of the studies (step test and physiological profile assessment).

Embase,Is lithium a neuroprotective agent?,"Vo, T.M.; Perry, P.; Ellerby, M.; Bohnert, K.","BACKGROUND: Lithium was the first clinically effective mood stabilizer marketed worldwide. However, the medical literature suggests that lithium may have an indication as a neuroprotective agent. METHODS: This review discusses the pharmacologic activity and potential effectiveness of lithium in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the 2 most prominent neurodegenerative disorders in the United States. The toxicities of lithium, including lithium-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (LI-EPS) and cognitive impairments at therapeutic blood levels, are discussed. Cases that are thought to illustrate LI-EPS and cognitive impairments are critiqued. RESULTS: Animal studies have shown positive results regarding the neuroprotective and antioxidant properties of lithium. Human studies indicate a potential benefit of lithium for improving cognition. Ongoing replicative studies are attempting to confirm the effectiveness and efficacy of lithium for treating patients diagnosed with AD or PD.

In the last three years, notwithstanding negative meta-analytic findings and the discouraging results of preventive trials against AD, some randomized controlled trials focusing particularly on dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subgroups with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and some recent meta-analyses have suggested a renowned role for EGb 761 for cognitive impairment and dementia. Meta-analytic findings suggested overall benefits of EGb 761 for stabilizing or slowing decline in cognition of subjects with cognitive impairment and dementia. The safety and tolerability of EGb 761 appeared to be excellent at different doses. Subgroup analyses showed that these clinical benefits of EGb 761 were mainly associated with the 240 mg/day dose, and also confirmed in the AD subgroup. More importantly, one of these meta-analyses showed clinical benefits in cognition, behavior, functional status, and global clinical change of EGb 761 at a dose of 240 mg/day in the treatment of patients with dementia, AD, and MCI with NPS.

Embase,Personality and dementia caring: A review and commentary,"Orgeta, V.; Leung, P.","Purpose of review: Carers of people with dementia are at increased risk of experiencing psychological distress. This article reviews recent findings on the role of personality traits for psychological outcomes for carers of people with dementia.Recent findings: Several studies have now established that personality influences the caregiving experience, carer wellbeing and outcomes such as coping ability, burden and caregiving style. Several moderators of these associations have also been identified such as the effect of kinship and type of dementia. There is consistent evidence that carer personality characteristics influence the progression of the disease such as cognitive decline and severity. Most of the recent studies identified in this review are cross-sectional.Summary: Taken together, these results indicate that personality is an important psychological resource for carers. Recent findings indicate that personality traits are associated with and influence both carer and patient outcomes. Future research is necessary to guide interventions and to expand further on our understanding of how personality factors shape adjustment to the caregiving role and how these impact on the progression of the disease.

We identified nine autosomal and two recessive disorders in the Basque population attributable to ancestral mutations (such as in PNRP, PARK8, FTDP-TDP43, LGMD2A, VCP, c9ORF72, and CMT4A), highly prevalent (DM1) or involving unique mutations (PARK1 or MAPT). Other genes were reported for their role as protective/risk factors in complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

Loneliness may influence cognitive function, but the exact nature of the association between loneliness and cognitive function is poorly understood. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize current findings on the association between loneliness and cognitive function in older adults. Method: A comprehensive, electronic review of the literature was performed. Criteria for inclusion were original quantitative or qualitative research, report written in English, human participants with a mean age â‰¥ 60 years, and published from January 2000 through July 2013. The total number of studies included in this systematic review was ten. Results: Main findings from the ten studies largely indicate that loneliness is significantly and negatively correlated with cognitive function, specifically in domains of global cognitive function or general cognitive ability, intelligence quotient (IQ), processing speed, immediate recall, and delayed recall. However, some initial correlations were not significant after controlling for a wide range of demographic and psychosocial risk factors thought to influence loneliness. Conclusions: Greater loneliness is associated with lower cognitive function. Although preliminary evidence is promising, additional studies are necessary to determine the causality and biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function.

To increase awareness of and participation in behaviors that may help maintain cognitive function or reduce risk of impairment, we need to understand public perceptions about risk and protective factors. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of studies examining the public's perceptions about risk and protective factors related to cognitive health and impairment published since the 2007 National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health.

Protective factors most commonly identified for maintaining cognitive health were intellectual/mental stimulation (n = 13), physical activity (n = 12), healthy diet (n = 10), and social/leisure activities (n = 10). Conclusions: Studies identified genetics and older age as key perceived risk factors more so than behaviors such as smoking.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) were originally assumed to be free from the risk of causing NMS, however several cases of NMS induced by SGAs (SGA-NMS) have been reported.Objectives: The aim of this study was to systematically review available studies and case reports on SGA-NMS and compare the presentation of NMS induced by different SGAs.Data Sources: Citations were retrieved from PubMed up to November 2013, and from reference lists of relevant citations.Study Eligibility Criteria: Eligibility criteria included (a) primary studies reporting data on NMS, with at least 50Â % of the sample receiving SGAs; or (b) case reports and case reviews reporting on NMS induced by SGA monotherapy, excluding those due to antipsychotic withdrawal.Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: A standardized method for data extraction and coding was developed for the analysis of eligible case reports.Results: Six primary studies and 186 individual cases of NMS induced by SGAs were included. Primary studies suggest that SGA-NMS is characterized by lower incidence, lower clinical severity, and less frequent lethal outcome than NMS induced by first-generation antipsychotics. Systematic analysis of case reports suggests that even the most recently marketed antipsychotics are not free from the risk of inducing NMS. Furthermore, clozapine-, aripiprazole- and amisulpride-induced NMS can present with atypical features more frequently than other SGA-NMS, i.e. displaying less intense extrapyramidal symptoms or high fever.Limitations: Case reports report non-systematic data, therefore analyses may be subject to bias.Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings: Clinicians should be aware that NMS is virtually associated with all antipsychotics, including those most recently marketed.

Design: This is a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials. Data Sources: Trials were identified with the help of PubMed, the Cochrane Dementia Group database, the Center for Collaborative Neurosciences, and references from reviews; no language restrictions were applied. Study Selection: All randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies on 30 ml/day of Cerebrolysin in mild-to-moderate AD were included. Results: There were 6 eligible randomized controlled trials comparing Cerebrolysin with placebo. For all studies, either individual patient data and/or published data (aggregate data) were available. Analyses were based on the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomized global clinical change and for safety criteria, on the standardized mean difference (SMD) for pooling of cognitive function, and on the Mann-Whitney statistic (MW) for multivariate analysis of 'global benefit' (combined effect of global clinical change and cognitive function). Cerebrolysin was significantly more effective than placebo at 4 weeks regarding cognitive function (4 weeks: SMD-0.40 points; 95% CI-0.66 to-0.13; p = 0.0031; 6 months: SMD-0.37 points; 95% CI-0.90 to 0.16; p = 0.1710), at 4 weeks and 6 months regarding global clinical change (4 weeks: OR 3.32; 95% CI 1.20-9.21; p = 0.0212; 6 months: OR 4.98; 95% CI 1.37-18.13; p = 0.0150), and at 4 weeks and 6 months regarding 'global benefit' (combined efficacy criteria; 4 weeks: MW 0.57, 95% CI 0.53-0.61; p = 0.0006; 6 months: MW 0.57; 95% CI 0.53-0.61; p = 0.0010). The safety aspects of Cerebrolysin were comparable to placebo.

Although cortical superficial siderosis has many possible causes, it is emerging as a key feature of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a common and important age-related cerebral small vessel disorder leading to intracerebral haemorrhage and dementia. In cerebral amyloid angiopathy cohorts, cortical superficial siderosis is associated with characteristic clinical symptoms, including transient focal neurological episodes; preliminary data also suggest an association with a high risk of future intracerebral haemorrhage, with potential implications for antithrombotic treatment decisions. Thus, cortical superficial siderosis is of relevance to neurologists working in neurovascular, memory and epilepsy clinics, and neurovascular emergency services, emphasizing the need for appropriate blood-sensitive magnetic resonance sequences to be routinely acquired in these clinical settings. In this review we focus on recent developments in neuroimaging and detection, aetiology, prevalence, pathophysiology and clinical significance of cortical superficial siderosis, with a particular emphasis on cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

Embase,The diagnosis and management of mild cognitive impairment: A clinical review,"Langa, K.M.; Levine, D.A.","Conclusions and Relevance: Cognitive decline and MCI have important implications for patients and their families and will require that primary care clinicians be skilled in identifying and managing this common disorder as the number of older adults increases in coming decades. Current evidence supports aerobic exercise, mental activity, and cardiovascular risk factor control in patients with MCI.Importance: Cognitive decline is a common and feared aspect of aging. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as the symptomatic predementia stage on the continuum of cognitive decline, characterized by objective impairment in cognition that is not severe enough to require help with usual activities of daily living.Objective: To present evidence on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of MCI and to provide physicians with an evidence-based framework for caring for older patients with MCI and their caregivers.Evidence Acquisition: We searched PubMed for English-language articles in peer-reviewed journals and the Cochrane Library database from inception through July 2014. Relevant references from retrieved articles were also evaluated.Findings: The prevalence of MCI in adults aged 65 years and older is 10% to 20%; risk increases with age and men appear to be at higher risk than women. In older patients with MCI, clinicians should consider depression, polypharmacy, and uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors, all of which may increase risk for cognitive impairment and other negative outcomes. Currently, no medications have proven effective for MCI; treatments and interventions should be aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk factors and prevention of stroke. Aerobic exercise, mental activity, and social engagement may help decrease risk of further cognitive decline. Although patients with MCI are at greater risk for developing dementia compared with the general population, there is currently substantial variation in risk estimates (from <5%to 20% annual conversion rates), depending on the population studied. Current research targets improving early detection and treatment of MCI, particularly in patients at high risk for progression to dementia.",2014,,JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association,312,23,2551-2561,,10.1001/jama.2014.13806,,#174,Langa 2014
Embase,Do patients with young onset Alzheimer's disease deteriorate faster than those with late onset Alzheimer's disease? A review of the literature,"Stanley, K.; Walker, Z.","Background: Young onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD; onset before 65 years of age) is thought to have a more rapid course and increased rate of progression compared to late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). This assumption appears partly due to important clinical, structural, neuropathological, and neurochemical differences suggesting YOAD is a separate entity to LOAD. The aim in this review was to systematically identify and examine appropriate studies comparing rate of cognitive decline between patients with YOAD and patients with LOAD. Methods: A computer-based literature search was initially undertaken, followed by citation tracking and search of related papers. Primary research studies specifically focused on the rate of cognitive decline between people with YOAD and LOAD were included. Studies were described, critically analyzed, presented, and discussed in the review. Results: Four studies were included, of which three were longitudinal and one was a case-control study. Three of the included studies found a faster rate of decline in patients with YOAD, and one found no difference in rate of decline between the two groups. Conclusions: The findings of the review are mixed and conflicting, and limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. There is a need for future research to design systematic studies that include sufficient sample sizes and follow-up periods, and control for possible confounding factors such as education level, baseline cognitive impairment, and vascular risk factors. This will help to validate the findings so far and improve our understanding of the rate of cognitive decline in people with YOAD and LOAD.",2014,,International Psychogeriatrics,26,12,1945-1953,,10.1017/S1041610214001173,,#173,Stanley 2014

Embase,"Systematic review of potential health risks posed by pharmaceutical, occupational and consumer exposures to metallic and nanoscale aluminum, aluminum oxides, aluminum hydroxide and its soluble salts","Willhite, C.C.; Karyakina, N.A.; Yokel, R.A.; Yenugadhati, N.; Wisniewski, T.M.; Arnold, I.M.F.; Momoli, F.; Krewski, D.","Aluminum (Al) is a ubiquitous substance encountered both naturally (as the third most abundant element) and intentionally (used in water, foods, pharmaceuticals, and vaccines); it is also present in ambient and occupational airborne particulates. Existing data underscore the importance of Al physical and chemical forms in relation to its uptake, accumulation, and systemic bioavailability. The present review represents a systematic examination of the peer-reviewed literature on the adverse health effects of Al materials published since a previous critical evaluation compiled by Krewski et al. (2007). Challenges encountered in carrying out the present review reflected the experimental use of different physical and chemical Al forms, different routes of administration, and different target organs in relation to the magnitude, frequency, and duration of exposure. Wide variations in diet can result in Al intakes that are often higher than the World Health Organization provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI), which is based on studies with Al citrate. Comparing daily dietary Al exposures on the basis of ""total Al""assumes that gastrointestinal bioavailability for all dietary Al forms is equivalent to that for Al citrate, an approach that requires validation. Current occupational exposure limits (OELs) for identical Al substances vary as much as 15-fold. The toxicity of different Al forms depends in large measure on their physical behavior and relative solubility in water. The toxicity of soluble Al forms depends upon the delivered dose of Al+3to target tissues. Trivalent Al reacts with water to produce bidentate superoxide coordination spheres [Al(O2)(H2O4)+2and Al(H2O)6+3] that after complexation with O2â€¢-, generate Al superoxides [Al(O2â€¢)](H2O5)]+2. Semireduced AlO2â€¢radicals deplete mitochondrial Fe and promote generation of H2O2, O2â€¢-and OHâ€¢. Thus, it is the Al+3-induced formation of oxygen radicals that accounts for the oxidative damage that leads to intrinsic apoptosis. In contrast, the toxicity of the insoluble Al oxides depends primarily on their behavior as particulates. Aluminum has been held responsible for human morbidity and mortality, but there is no consistent and convincing evidence to associate the Al found in food and drinking water at the doses and chemical forms presently consumed by people living in North America and Western Europe with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neither is there clear evidence to show use of Al-containing underarm antiperspirants or cosmetics increases the risk of AD or breast cancer. Metallic Al, its oxides, and common Al salts have not been shown to be either genotoxic or carcinogenic. Aluminum exposures during neonatal and pediatric parenteral nutrition (PN) can impair bone mineralization and delay neurological development. Adverse effects to vaccines with Al adjuvants have occurred; however, recent controlled trials found that the immunologic response to certain vaccines with Al adjuvants was no greater, and in some cases less than, that after identical vaccination without Al adjuvants. The scientific literature on the adverse health effects of Al is extensive. Health risk assessments for Al must take into account individual co-factors (e.g., age, renal function, diet, gastric pH). Conclusions from the current review point to the need for refinement of the PTWI, reduction of Al contamination in PN solutions, justification for routine addition of Al to vaccines, and harmonization of OELs for Al substances.",2014,,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,44,"(Willhite C.C., calvinwillhite@hotmail.com; Karyakina N.A.; Krewski D.)

Embase,Non-cardiovascular effects associated with statins,"Desai, C.S.; Martin, S.S.; Blumenthal, R.S.","Statins form the pharmacologic cornerstone of the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition to beneficial cardiovascular effects, statins seem to have multiple non-cardiovascular effects. Although early concerns about statin induced hepatotoxicity and cancer have subsided owing to reassuring evidence, two of the most common concerns that clinicians have are myopathy and diabetes. Randomized controlled trials suggest that statins are associated with a modest increase in the risk of myositis but not the risk of myalgia. Severe myopathy (rhabdomyolysis) is rare and often linked to a statin regimen that is no longer recommended (simvastatin 80 mg). Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggest an increase in the risk of diabetes with statins, particularly with higher intensity regimens in people with two or more components of the metabolic syndrome. Other non-cardiovascular effects covered in this review are contrast induced nephropathy, cognition, cataracts, erectile dysfunction, and venous thromboembolism. Currently, systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines indicate that the cardiovascular benefits of statins generally outweigh non-cardiovascular harms in patients above a certain threshold of cardiovascular risk. Literature is also accumulating on the potential non-cardiovascular benefits of statins, which could lead to novel applications of this class of drug in the future.",2014,,BMJ (Online),349,"(Desai C.S., cdesai6@jhmi.edu; Martin S.S.; Blumenthal R.S.)

Embase,Caregiver burden: A clinical review,"Adelman, R.D.; Tmanova, L.L.; Delgado, D.; Dion, S.; Lachs, M.S.","IMPORTANCE: Caregiver burden may result from providing care for patients with chronic illness. It can occur in any of the 43.5 million individuals providing support to midlife and older adults. Caregiver burden is frequently overlooked by clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To outline the epidemiology of caregiver burden; to provide strategies to diagnose, assess, and intervene for caregiver burden in clinical practice; and to evaluate evidence on interventions intended to avert or mitigate caregiver burden and related caregiver distress. EVIDENCE: Cohort studies examining the relation between demographic and social risk factors and adverse outcomes of caregiver burden were reviewed. Review of recent meta-analyses to summarize the effectiveness of caregiver burden interventions were identified by searching Ovid MEDLINE, AgeLine, and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: Risk factors for caregiver burden include female sex, low educational attainment, residence with the care recipient, higher number of hours spent caregiving, depression, social isolation, financial stress, and lack of choice in being a caregiver. Practical assessment strategies for caregiver burden exist to evaluate caregivers, their care recipients, and the care recipient's overall caregiving needs. A variety of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions have shown mild to modest efficacy in mitigating caregiver burden and associated manifestations of caregiver distress in high-qualitymeta-analyses. Psychosocial interventions include support groups or psychoeducational interventions for caregivers of dementia patients (effect size, 0.09-0.23). Pharmacologic interventions include use of anticholinergics or antipsychotic medications for dementia or dementia-related behaviors in the care recipient (effect size, 0.18-0.27). Many studies showed improvements in caregiver burden-associated symptoms (eg, mood, coping, self-efficacy) even when caregiver burden itselfwas minimally improved. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Physicians have a responsibility to recognize caregiver burden. Caregiver assessment and intervention should be tailored to the individual circumstances and contexts in which caregiver burden occurs. Copyright 2014 American Medical Association.

Embase,Huperzine A in the treatment of alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: A meta-analysis,"Xing, S.-H.; Zhu, C.-X.; Zhang, R.; An, L.","The objective of our study was to perform an updated meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs of Huperzine A (Hup A) on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), in order to provide the basis and reference for clinical rational drug use. The primary outcome measures assessed were minimental state examination (MMSE) and activities of daily living scale (ADL). Eight AD trials with 733 participants and two VD trials with 92 participants that met our inclusion criteria were identified. The results showed that Hup A could significantly improve the MMSE and ADL score of AD and VD patients, and longer durations would result in better efficacy for the patients with AD. It seemed that there was significant improvement of cognitive function measured by memory quotient (MQ) in patients with AD. Most adverse effects in AD were generally of mild to moderate severity and transient. Compared to the patients with AD, Hup A may offer fewer side effects for participants with VD in this study. Therefore, Hup A is a well-tolerated drug that could significantly improve cognitive performance in patients with AD or VD, but we need to use it with caution in the clinical treatment.

Embase,Underrepresentation of patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment in pharmaceutical trials on prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for delirium: A systematic review,"De Jonghe, A.; Van de Glind, E.M.M.; Van Munster, B.C.; De Rooij, S.E.","Objective: Representation of hospitalized patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment in pharmaceutical delirium trials is important because these patients are at high risk for developing delirium. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate whether patients with cognitive impairment were included in studies on pharmacological prophylaxis or treatment of delirium and to explore the motivations for their exclusion (if they were excluded). Study design: This study was a systematic review. A MEDLINE search was performed for publications dated from 1 January 1985 to 15 November 2012. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials that investigated medication to prevent or treat delirium were included. The number of patients with cognitive impairment was counted, and if they were excluded, motivations were noted. Results: The search yielded 4293 hits, ultimately resulting in 31 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, five studies explicitly mentioned the percentage of patients with cognitive impairment that were included. These patients comprised a total of 8% (n. = 279 patients) of the 3476 patients included in all 31 studies. Ten studies might have included cognitively impaired patients but did not mention the exact percentage, and sixteen studies excluded all patients with cognitive impairment. The motivations for exclusion varied, but most were related to the influence of dementia on delirium. Conclusion: The exclusion of patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment hampers the generalizability of the results of these trials and leaves clinicians with limited evidence about the pharmacological treatment of this group of vulnerable patients who have an increased risk of side effects.

Embase,Familial coaggregation of alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Feldman, A.L.; Johansson, A.L.V.; Lambert, P.C.; Sieurin, J.; Yang, F.; Pedersen, N.L.; Wirdefeldt, K.","Background: Familial aggregation has been shown for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) separately, and it has been hypothesized that these diseases also coaggregate in families. Methods: The authors investigated familial coaggregation of AD and PD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed was searched for relevant studies published through the end of October 2012. Three independent investigators screened publications and extracted data. Relative risk estimates of AD risk associated with family history of PD or parkinsonism, or PD risk associated with family history of AD or dementia, were summarized into metaestimates using random effects models. Heterogeneity and publication bias were tested using Higgins' and Egger's tests, respectively. Results: We included 16 studies in the review, with 14 included in any meta-analysis. AD risk associated with family history of PD yielded a summary hazard ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.00-1.39) based on 5 reconstructed cohort studies and a summary odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 (95% CI: 0.92-2.12) based on 7 case-control studies. PD risk associated with family history of AD yielded a summary OR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.49-1.16) based on 3 studies. There was no significant heterogeneity among studies, nor significant publication bias. Conclusions: There may be familial coaggregation of AD and PD, although the association was modest and only apparent when studying AD risk associated with family history of PD. Â© 2013 S.

Embase,Effect of meditation on cognitive functions in context of aging and neurodegenerative diseases,"Marciniak, R.; Sheardova, K.; ÄŒermÃ¡kovÃ¡, P.; HudeÄçek, D.; Å umec, R.; Hort, J.","Effect of different meditation practices on various aspects of mental and physical health is receiving growing attention. The present paper reviews evidence on the effects of several mediation practices on cognitive functions in the context of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The effect of meditation in this area is still poorly explored. Seven studies were detected through the databases search, which explores the effect of meditation on attention, memory, executive functions, and other miscellaneous measures of cognition in a sample of older people and people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, reviewed studies suggested a positive effect of meditation techniques, particularly in the area of attention, as well as memory, verbal fluency, and cognitive flexibility. These findings are discussed in the context of MRI studies suggesting structural correlates of the effects. Meditation can be a potentially suitable non-pharmacological intervention aimed at the prevention of cognitive decline in the elderly. However, the conclusions of these studies are limited by their methodological flaws and differences of various types of meditation techniques. Further research in this direction could help to verify the validity of the findings and clarify the problematic aspects.

(Family Eucommiaceae), also known as DÃ_-zhÃ_ng (Chinese:), Tuchong (in Japanese), is the sole species of the genus Eucommia. The leaf, stem, and bark as well as staminate flower of Eucommia ulmoides have been traditionally used to cure many diseases in China, Japan, Korea, among others. The aim of this review is to comprehensively outline the botanical description, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological activities, and toxicology of Eucommia ulmoides and to discuss possible trends for further study of Eucommia ulmoides. Materials and methods Information on Eucommia ulmoides was gathered via the internet (using Pub Med, Elsevier, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, Medline Plus, ACS, CNKI, and Web of Science) and from books in local libraries. Results One-hundred twelve compounds of Eucommia ulmoides, including the main active constituents, lignans and iridoids, have been isolated and identified. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that monomer compounds and extracts from Eucommia ulmoides possess wide-ranging pharmacological actions, especially in treating hypertension, hyperlipemia, diabetes, obesity, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, aging, lupus-like syndrome, and immunoregulation. Conclusions Eucommia ulmoides has been used as a source of traditional medicine and as a beneficial health food. Phytochemical and pharmacological studies of Eucommia ulmoides have received much interest, and extracts and active compounds continue to be isolated and proven to exert various effects. Further toxicity and clinical studies are warranted to establish more detailed data on crude extracts and pure compounds, enabling more convenient preparations for patients. Therefore, this review on the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological activities, and toxicity of Eucommia ulmoides will provide helpful data for further studies as well as the commercial exploitation of this traditional medicine.

Embase,Prescribing menopausal hormone therapy: An evidence-based approach,"Sood, R.; Faubion, S.S.; Kuhle, C.L.; Thielen, J.M.; Shuster, L.T.","The constantly changing landscape regarding menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been challenging for providers caring for menopausal women. After a decade of fear and uncertainty regarding MHT, reanalysis of the Women's Health Initiative data and the results of recent studies have provided some clarity regarding the balance of risks and benefits of systemic MHT. Age and years since menopause are now known to be important variables affecting the benefit-risk profile. For symptomatic menopausal women who are under 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause, the benefits of MHT generally outweigh the risks. Systemic MHT initiated early in menopause appears to slow the progression of atherosclerotic disease, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. During this window of opportunity, MHT might also provide protection against cognitive decline. In older women and women more than 10 years past menopause, the risk-benefit balance of MHT is less favorable, particularly with regard to cardiovascular risk and cognitive impairment. For women entering menopause prematurely (<40 years), MHT ameliorates the risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline. Nonoral administration of estrogen offers advantages due to the lack of first-pass hepatic metabolism, which in turn avoids the increased hepatic synthesis of clotting proteins, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and sex hormone-binding globulin. The duration of combined MHT use is ideally limited to less than 5 years because of the known increase in breast cancer risk after 3-5 years of use. Limitations to use of estrogen only MHT are less clear, since breast cancer risk does not appear to increase with use of estrogen alone. For women under the age of 60 years, or within 10 years of onset of natural menopause, MHT for the treatment of bothersome menopausal symptoms poses low risk and is an acceptable option, particularly when nonhormonal management approaches fail.

The findings from prospective studies and very recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggested that adherence to the MeDi fulfilling the whole-diet approach may affect not only the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but also of predementia syndromes and their progression to overt dementia. However, some concerns exist regarding how these instruments have been developed for measuring adherence to the MeDi, suggesting a better qualitative and quantitative selection of the individual dietary components and/or food groups to improve their reliability.

However, the need to address the problem of late life mood disorders in a real-world setting is met with a surprising lack of strong evidence in this field. Randomised clinical trials which focus on elderly mood disorders are not very common and the majority of them focus on pharmacological treatment of major depression. The aim of this study was to review first the main unmet needs and research challenges in late-life mood disorders as a basis to then review the state of the art evidence resulting from randomised clinical trials and the main critical aspects of their implementation. Comorbidity as well as polypharmacy, cognitive decline, unpredictable placebo response, and uncertainty on optimal duration of trials are some of the challenges the investigator has to address. Moreover, some methodological limitations of randomised clinical trials reduce the applicability of the results of such studies to common clinical practices and have encouraged some authors to investigate the existence of possible alternative research designs such as pragmatic randomised clinical trials.

This Position Paper considers the strengths and limitations of the IWG research diagnostic criteria and proposes advances to improve the diagnostic framework. On the basis of these refinements, the diagnosis of AD can be simplified, requiring the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype (typical or atypical) and a pathophysiological biomarker consistent with the presence of Alzheimer's pathology. We propose that downstream topographical biomarkers of the disease, such as volumetric MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, might better serve in the measurement and monitoring of the course of disease.

Embase,Cardiovascular effects of drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease,"Howes, L.G.","Drugs that are used to treat Alzheimer's disease include the acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors (ACHIs) donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Adverse cardiovascular events with these drugs are very uncommon. However, there is evidence that ACHI therapy is associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of syncope and bradycardia. There are also a few reports that these drugs may occasionally be associated with QT prolongation and torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Adverse cardiovascular effects of ACHIs including syncope and bradycardia are less common than their adverse gastrointestinal effects, but they remain important considerations in susceptible individuals. In contrast, animal studies and some observational studies suggest that ACHIs may reduce myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality and have favourable effects on hemodynamics and survival in heart failure. Further research is required to confirm these potential beneficial effects. Little is known about the cardiovascular effects of memantine but there have been reports of bradycardia and reduced cardiovascular survival associated with its use.

This is relevant for the US military because the prevalence of smoking in the military is approximately 11% higher than in civilians. Methods A systematic review of published studies on the association between smoking and increased risk for AD and preclinical and human literature on the relationships between smoking, nicotine exposure, and AD-related neuropathology was conducted. Original data from comparisons of smoking and never-smoking cognitively normal elders on in vivo amyloid imaging are also presented. Results Overall, literature indicates that former/active smoking is related to a significantly increased risk for AD. Cigarette smoke/smoking is associated with AD neuropathology in preclinical models and humans. Smoking-related cerebral oxidative stress is a potential mechanism promoting AD pathology and increased risk for AD.

Embase,Sleep related amnestic behaviors due to zolpidem,"CubaÅ‚a, W.J.; Gabrielsson, A.","The imidazopyridine zolpidem, introduced to the market in 1988, is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic acting as an agonist on the central GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor complex. Zolpidem is considered to have a lower abuse and dependence-potential than benzodiazepines, and is therefore a widely used medication in the short-term treatment of insomnia. Zolpidem is commonly used recreationally, often in combination with alcohol causing an euphoric feeling, visual distortions, hallucinations and decreased anxiety in people taking high doses. However, several case reports describing sleep related amnestic behaviors due to zolpidem have been reported. Predisposing and precipitating factors for such behaviors remain unclear. The aim of this work is to re-evaluate cases of such behavior described in the literature, with emphasis on common traits, patterns and predisposing factors. A systematic review of case reports ased on a Medline search was conducted including the years 1966-2012 to assemble available case reports analyzed for typical features of abuse/dependence. Only case reports were of interest. Clinical studies were excluded. The terms ""zolpidem"" cross-referenced with ""psychosis"", ""adverse drug reaction"",""complex amnestic behavior"", ""sleep"" were used to identify relevant publications. A total of 47 cases were identified. Female individuals were more involved. Cases were reported in all age groups. Use of alcohol, drugs or cigarettes was reported in a minority of these cases. Subjects suffering from mood disorders were more prone to develop sleep related amnestic behavior as a side effect of therapeutic doses of zolpidem. The majority of patients were exposed to concomitant treatment with psychotropics and monoaminergic drugs were the most prominent ones. This review suggests a possibility of incidence of psychotic symptoms and sleep related amnestic behavioral disturbances in patients prescribed zolpidem along with monoaminergic agents. Sleep-related behaviors associated with zolpidem need to be taken into consideration as an adverse drug reaction before drug prescription, and an evaluation of potential risk factors should be undertaken. The risk for the complex behaviors associated with zolpidem seems to be higher in women and in cases of concomitant medication with monoaminergic drugs.

Embase,"Blood markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in lacunar stroke versus non-lacunar stroke and non-stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Wiseman, S.; Marlborough, F.; Doubal, F.; Webb, D.J.; Wardlaw, J.","Background: The cause of cerebral small vessel disease is not fully understood, yet it is important, accounting for about 25% of all strokes. It also increases the risk of having another stroke and contributes to about 40% of dementias. Various processes have been implicated, including microatheroma, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. A previous review investigated endothelial dysfunction in lacunar stroke versus mostly non-stroke controls while another looked at markers of inflammation and endothelial damage in ischaemic stroke in general. We have focused on blood markers between clinically evident lacunar stroke and other subtypes of ischaemic stroke, thereby controlling for stroke in general. Summary: We systematically assessed the literature for studies comparing blood markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in lacunar stroke versus non-stroke controls or other ischaemic stroke subtypes. We assessed the quality of included papers and meta-analysed results. We split the analysis on time of blood draw in relation to the stroke. We identified 1,468 full papers of which 42 were eligible for inclusion, including 4,816 ischaemic strokes, of which 2,196 were lacunar and 2,500 non-stroke controls. Most studies subtyped stroke using TOAST. The definition of lacunar stroke varied between studies. Markers of coagulation/fibrinolysis (tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), fibrinogen, D-dimer) were higher in lacunar stroke versus non-stroke although fibrinogen was no different to non-stroke in the acute phase. tPA and PAI were no different between lacunar and non-lacunar stroke. Fibrinogen and D-dimer were significantly lower in lacunar stroke compared to other ischaemic strokes, both acutely and chronically. Markers of endothelial dysfunction (homocysteine, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), E-selectin, P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM)) were higher or had insufficient or conflicting data (P-selectin, VCAM) in lacunar stroke versus non-stroke. Compared to other ischaemic stroke subtypes, homocysteine did not differ in lacunar stroke while vWF was significantly lower in lacunar stroke acutely [atherothrombotic standardized mean difference, SMD, -0.34 (-0.61, -0.08); cardioembolic SMD -0.38 (-0.62, -0.14)], with insufficient data chronically. Markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6)) were higher in lacunar stroke versus non-stroke, although there were no studies measuring TNF-Î± chronically and the sole study measuring IL-6 chronically showed no difference between lacunar stroke and non-stroke. Compared to other ischaemic stroke subtypes, there was no difference (CRP) or insufficient or conflicting data (TNF-Î±) to lacunar stroke. IL-6 was significantly lower [atherothrombotic SMD -0.37 (-0.63, -0.10); cardioembolic SMD -0.52 (-0.82, -0.22)] in lacunar stroke acutely, with insufficient data chronically. Key Messages: Lacunar stroke is an important stroke subtype. More studies comparing lacunar stroke to non-lacunar stroke specifically, rather than to non-stroke controls, are needed. Prospective studies with measurements taken well after the acute event are more likely to be helpful in determining pathogenesis. The available data in this review were limited and do not exclude the possibility that peripheral inflammatory processes including endothelial dysfunction are associated with lacunar stroke and cerebral small vessel disease.

The burden of IDD, in terms of emotional suffering and associated health care costs, is significant; prevention and treatment therefore are important. A systematic literature review, updated in 2013, identified 89 inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), which present with IDD as prominent feature and are amenable to causal therapy. Therapeutic effects include improvement and/or stabilization of psychomotor/cognitive development, behavior/psychiatric disturbances, seizures, neurologic and systemic manifestations. The levels of available evidence for the various treatments range from Level 1b, c (n=5); Level 2a, b, c (n=14); Level 4 (n=53), and Levels 4-5 (n=27). For a target audience comprising clinical and biochemical geneticists, child neurologists and developmental pediatricians, five experts translated...this data into a 2-tiered diagnostic algorithm: The first tier comprises metabolic ""screening"" tests in urine and blood, which are relatively accessible, affordable, less invasive, and have the potential to identify 60% of all treatable IEMs. The second tier investigations for the remaining disorders are ordered based on individual clinical signs and symptoms. This algorithm is supported by an App www.treatable-id.org, which comprises up-to-date information on all 89 IEMs, relevant diagnostic tests, therapies and a search function based on signs and symptoms. These recommendations support the clinician in early identification of treatable IEMs in the child with IDD, allowing for timely initiation of therapy with the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. The need for future studies to determine yield and usefulness of these recommendations, with subsequent updates and improvements to developments in the field, is outlined.

Embase,Dementia studies in Chinese populations,"Pei, J.-J.; Giron, M.S.T.; Jia, J.; Wang, H.-X.","Variations in the prevalence of dementia in different ethnic groups have been reported worldwide, and a number of reviews have provided a picture of epidemiological studies in dementia research. However, little is known about epidemiological studies in Chinese populations. In this review, we searched PubMed and the Web of Science for original research articles published in English up to July 2013 on the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of dementia in Chinese populations worldwide. Except for the prevalence, we included only population-based follow-up studies. We identified 25 studies in elderly Chinese residents in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, and found a higher prevalence of dementia in Mainland China than in the other locations, which may be due to that the studies from Mainland China are more recent than those from other locations. A notable increase in incidence was observed when dementia cases were diagnosed using 10/66 diagnostic criteria compared to other criteria. Studies on risk factors for dementia were limited and mostly from Mainland China. Age, gender, education, smoking, and alcohol consumption were related to the risk of dementia in Chinese populations. Only two prognostic studies were identified, and age, gender, and residential area were related to the prognosis of dementia. In conclusion, the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for dementia found in Chinese populations were comparable to other ethnic groups, but no conclusive results on prognosis were found. The differences in prevalence and incidence were influenced by the diagnostic criteria and the time of study. Longitudinal population-based studies on the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of dementia in Chinese populations are required.

Depression symptoms can precede clinical diagnosis of AD for years or occurs around the onset of AD, although the etiology and pathologic mechanism of depression in AD pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we provide an overview on recent studies, indicating that genetic factors, neuroanatomic changes, vascular risk factors, and the imbalance of neurotransmitters might contribute to depressive symptoms in AD. Tau pathology and amyloid-Î_ accumulation also correlate with depression in AD. In addition, the alteration of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory pathway, and neurotrophin deficiency are the possible biological mechanisms linking depression and AD, and might become the potential targets for AD treatment. Current data support that antidepressants are promising to alleviate the symptom, though the efficacy is controversial. Moreover, antidementia medication and non-pharmacological interventions can be potential choices. In this review, we describe the prevalence and clinical course of depression in AD, analyze the underlying mechanisms, and discuss the possible management strategies for depression in patients with AD.",2014,,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,42,3,739-755,,10.3233/JAD-140324,,#132,Chi 2014
Embase,Evaluation and treatment of older patients with hypercholesterolemia: A clinical review,"Strandberg, T.E.; Kolehmainen, L.; Vuorio, A.","IMPORTANCE: Hypercholesterolemia is common among people older than 80 years. Substantial functional heterogeneity exists among older patients, and decision making for statin use differs in older patients relative to younger ones. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the presentation, modifying factors, and treatment of hypercholesterolemia (usually with statins) among persons older than 80 years. EVIDENCE REVIEW MEDLINE: and other sources were searched from January 1990 to June 2014. Personal libraries and a hand search of reference lists from guidelines and reviews from January 2000 to June 2014 were also used. FINDINGS: Norandomized clinical trials (RCTs) of statin or any other hypocholesterolemic medication included persons older than80years at baseline. Findings from 75- to 80-year-old patients enrolled in RCTs and information from observational studies support statin treatment for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and probably in patients with diabetes without ASCVD. Harms from statin drugs are not increased in older patients, so the use of these agents for primary prevention is possible. Because people older than80years are biologically heterogeneous with varying life expectancy,may have frailty or comorbid conditions, andmay take multiple medications, the decision to treat with statins must be individualized. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ideally, treatment of hypercholesterolemia for patients at risk of ASCVD should start before they turn 80 years old. No RCT evidence exists to guide statin initiation after age 80 years. Decisions to use statins in older individuals are made individually and are not supported by high-quality evidence.",2014,,JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association,312,11,1136-1144,,10.1001/jama.2014.10924,,#131,Strandberg 2014

This systematic review assesses the current evidence of a therapeutic- and prophylactic effect of melatonin in adult patients against depression or depressive symptoms. A search was performed in The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO for published trials on November 14th 2013. Inclusion criteria were English language, RCTs or crossover trials. Our outcome was measurement of depression/depressive symptoms with a validated clinician-administered or self-rating questionnaire. PRISMA recommendations were followed and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool used. Ten studies in 486 patients were included in the final qualitative synthesis and four studies, 148 patients, were included in two meta-analyses. Melatonin doses varied from 0.5-6. mg daily and the length of follow-up varied from 2 weeks to 3.5 years. Three studies were done on patients without depression at inclusion, two studies in patients with depression and five studies included a mixture. Six studies showed an improvement in depression scores in both the melatonin and placebo groups but there was no significant difference. One study showed a significant prophylactic effect and another found a significant treatment effect on depression with melatonin compared to placebo.

Ever-increasing use of melatonin supplements and enlarging research evidences make the authors undertook the review to arrive at a qualitative conclusion whether melatonin supplements can act as potential treatment options or not. Methodology: A comprehensive search was undertaken in different electronic databases using various search terms. A total of 225 studies were identified including clinical research studies and basic experiments. Data were extracted individually from the studies and compiled in the end. Results: Melatonin has been used successfully in chronic insomnia and as an anti-oxidant in cancer and other age-related neuro-degenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease and Autistic disorders. Its evidences of use in other conditions remained insufficient and inconclusive. Conclusion: Melatonin therapy may be considered as efficacious and safe in insomnia and as an anti-oxidant; however, other roles needs to be evaluated in further studies.

Although the mechanisms of acquiring this impairment are poorly understood, several risk factors have been identified. Unfortunately, no easy means of predicting long-term cognitive impairment exists. Despite this barrier, research is ongoing to test possible treatments for cognitive impairment.

As a ""back door to the brain"", PFO can serve as a conduit for paradoxical embolism, allowing venous thrombi to enter the arterial circulation, avoiding filtration by the lungs, and causing ischemic stroke. PFO-related strokes affect more than 150,000 people per year in the US, and PFO is present in up to 60% of migraine patients with aura, and in one out of four normal individuals. So, in such a highly prevalent condition, what are the best treatment and prevention strategies? Emerging studies show PFO-related neurovascular disease to be a multi-organ condition with varying individual risk factors that may require individualized therapeutic approaches - opening the field for new pharmacologic and therapeutic targets. The anatomy of PFO suggests that, in addition to thrombi, it can also allow harmful circulatory factors to travel directly from the venous to the arterial circulation, a concept important in finding novel therapeutic targets for PFO-related neurovascular injury. Here, we: 1) review emerging data on PFO-related injuries and clinical trials; 2) discuss potential mechanisms of PFO-related neurovascular disease in the context of multi-organ interaction and heart-brain signaling; and 3) discuss novel therapeutic targets and research frontiers. Clinical studies and molecular mapping of the circulatory landscape of this multi-organ disease will both be necessary in order to better individualize clinical treatment for a condition affecting more than a quarter of the world's population.

Embase,Estrogen and the brain: Does estrogen treatment improve cognitive function?,"Hogervorst, E.","In this paper we describe potential reasons for the discrepancies between data from basic sciences and observational studies and those of large treatment studies investigating the association between brain function and sex steroids. Observational studies which often showed positive associations between hormone use and cognition can be affected by 'recall bias' and 'healthy user bias', while outcomes of treatment studies were hypothesized to be modified by age at treatment, age at or type of menopause, health status, addition of a progestogen or type of estrogen treatment. However, meta-analyses of data from treatment studies negate many of these hypotheses showing at best mainly short-term (up to 6 months) positive effects of estrogen treatment on cognition regardless of age. This positive effect may reverse, particularly in older women with prolonged hormone treatment, which was predominantly seen after addition of progestogen. Medroxyprogesterone acetate seemed to have worse effects on cognition than other types of progestogen in these long-term studies. Estradiol with or without a progestogen was three times more likely to have positive effects on cognition than conjugated equine estrogens. However, two-thirds of studies showed no associations at all which may be an underestimate given the possibility of publication bias. We briefly review alternative treatments, such as testosterone and soy-derived supplements, but currently insufficient data are available for conclusive comments. Women who have undergone surgical menopause or who undergo natural menopause before age 47 may benefit most from hormone treatment and a special case may need to be made for this group.

Embase,Molecular mechanisms of depression: Perspectives on new treatment strategies,"Lang, U.E.; Borgwardt, S.","Depression is a multicausal disorder and has been associated with the risk to develop cancer, dementia, diabetes, epilepsy and stroke. As a metabolic disorder depression has been associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin sensitivity, neuropeptide Y, glucose regulation, poor glycemic control, glucagone-like peptide-1, cholezystokinin, ghrelin, leptin, the endocannabinoid system, insulin-like growth factor and gastrin-releasing peptide. As a cardiovascular disease a close relationship exists between depression and blood pressure, heart rate, norepinephrine, sympathetic tone, vascular resistance, blood viscosity, plasma volume, intima thickness and atherosclerosis. Additionally blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, D-dimers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 protein, platelet activation, VEGF, plasma nitric oxide and its synthase are changed in depressed patients. As an endocrinological and stress disorder depression has been connected with the concentration of free T 4, TSH, CRH, arginine vasopressin, corticotrophin, corticosteroid release and ACTH. Depression as an inflammatory disorder is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, TNF-alpha, soluble interleukin-2 receptors, interferon-alpha, interleukin 8, interleukin-10, hs-CRP, acute phase proteins, haptoglobin, toll like receptor 4, interleukin-1beta, mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, substance P, cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin-E2, lipid peroxidation levels and acid sphingomyelinase. Nutritional factors might influence depression risk, i.e. the consumption of folate, omega-3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. The neurodegenerative hypothesis of depression explains decreased hippocampal volumes in depressed patients and changes of neurotrophic support by BDNF, erythropoietin, GDNF, FGF-2, NT3, NGF and growth hormone. In this context, a fast neuroprotective and antidepressant effect has also been observed by ketamine, which acts via the glutamatergic system. Hence, GABA, AMPA, EAAT, NMDA- and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 to mGluR8) have gained interest in depression recently. Alternative, causative or also easy available treatment strategies beyond serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition might be a major topic of future psychiatric care.

Positive responses to regular physical exercise, such as enhanced functional capacity, increased autonomy and improved self-esteem, are frequently described in the recent literature, and these responses are all good reasons for recommending regular exercise. In addition, physical exercise may improve both mood and adherence to an exercise program in healthy individuals and might modulate both the performance and mental health of athletes. Exercise is associated with the increased synthesis and release of both neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, and these increases may be associated with neurogenesis, angiogenesis and neuroplasticity.

The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, so also dementia increases in later life. As the population ages, type 2 diabetes and AD are increasing. Both diseases are chronic and are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies showed that older people with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of cognitive decline. The precise mechanism linking the two remains to be found out. Several hypothetical mechanisms have been postulated. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for AD and vascular dementia. The association between diabetes and AD is particularly strong among carriers of the APOE 4. Several studies have linked dementia to diabetes. Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance have also been associated with poor cognitive performance and at risk of developing cognitive impairment. Studies have suggested that metabolic syndrome may be linked to vascular dementia, while contrasting findings showed the role of metabolic syndrome to AD. In this review, how diabetes and cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease are mutually linked, possible mechanism linking the two and some possible therapeutic interventions with some patents that seem to be good therapeutic targets in future are discussed.

Data sources: PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched up to September 2012. Reference lists of included studies were also searched. Inclusion criteria were studies measuring factors specifically related to 6-month outcome in patients diagnosed with dementia in any residential or health-care setting. Results: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, five of which were set in the United States and two in Israel. Methodology and prognostic outcomes varied greatly between the studies. All but one study found that Functional Assessment Staging phase 7c, currently widely used to assess hospice admission eligibility in the United States, was not a reliable predictor of 6-month mortality. The most common prognostic variables identified related to nutrition/nourishment, or eating habits, followed by increased risk on dementia severity scales and comorbidities. Conclusions: Although the majority of studies agreed that the Functional Assessment Staging 7c criterion was not a reliable predictor of 6-month mortality, we found a lack of prognosticator concordance across the literature. Further studies are essential to identify reliable, sensitive, and specific prognosticators, which can be applied to the clinical setting and allow increased availability of palliative care to dementia patients.

Embase,Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk of depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Ju, S.-Y.; Lee, Y.-J.; Jeong, S.-N.","Objective: No quantitative systematic review or meta-analysis of population-based epidemiological studies has been conducted to assess the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and the risk of depression. This study aimed to summarize the current evidence from cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies that have evaluated the association between 25(OH)D levels and the risk of depression. Methods: Relevant studies were identified by systematically searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases through April 2012. Cross-sectional and cohort studies that reported adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of interest were included. The reported risk estimates for 25(OH)D categories were recalculated, employing a comprehensive trend estimation from summarized dose-response data. A pooled OR was calculated separately for cross-sectional and cohort studies using random-effects models. Results: In the meta-analysis, 25(OH)D levels were significantly inversely associated with depression in 5 of 11 case-control studies and 2 of 5 cohort studies. The pooled estimate of the adjusted OR of depression in 11 cross-sectional studies (n = 43,137) was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94-0.99, I2 = 63%) for a 10 ng/ml increase in 25(OH)D levels. The 5 included cohort studies comprised 12,648 participants, primarily elderly individuals, whose serum 25(OH)D levels were measured, and 2,663 experienced depression events during follow-up. The pooled adjusted OR of depression was 0.92 (95% CI = 0.87-0.98, I2 = 50%) for a 10 ng/ml increase in 25(OH)D levels. Conclusions: Our results indicate an inverse association between serum 25(OH)D levels and the risk of depression. Further studies are warranted to establish whether this association is causal.

Embase,Risk perception and its role in attitudes toward blood transfusion: A qualitative systematic review,"Ngo, L.T.; Bruhn, R.; Custer, B.","Despite improvements in blood safety making transfusion a much safer clinical procedure, the general public still perceives it as risky. We systematically reviewed available literature to examine evidence regarding the reasons and causes behind this perception. Electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE for literature dating back to the 1980s were searched. Eligible studies collected information on blood recipients' demographics, measures of risk domains (sets of values that risks encompass), and general knowledge of blood transfusion in terms of risks and benefits. Each study was assessed for quality of data, research method, and relevant findings. A scoring system was used to subjectively rate the overall quality of each study. Each study was reviewed for its method of data collection and information abstracted on hazards and conceptual dimensions used to measure risk. Risk perception between blood transfusion and other hazards including alternatives to transfusion were compared. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, all of which were conducted outside the United States, with most of the studies published more than 10 years ago and conducted by only 3 research groups. Five studies were rated as being very good, four good, five fair, and one of poor quality. The finding of the studies consistently show that objective or raw knowledge is not correlated with risk perception, but subjective or calibrated knowledge is. Thus, it is what people think they know rather than what they actually do know that influences risk perception of transfusion. Of the 3 common conceptual domains-dread, unknown risk, and benefits-blood transfusion was found to be of intermediate dread, intermediate unknown risk, and most beneficial compared with other hazards. Donated blood was found to have lower perceived risk than all other alternatives to transfusion, except for use of autologous blood. There is a lack of recent studies on allogeneic transfusion. However, the more recent studies show that perceived high risk is still prevalent in the general public. The available risk perception studies suggest that although blood transfusion is safe, elevated risk perception of infections persists. Studies of the US population are needed to better understand the influence of both psychological and scientific factors.

Embase,Cognitive impairment associated with Atrial fibrillation: A meta-analysis,"Kalantarian, S.; Stern, T.A.; Mansour, M.; Ruskin, J.N.","Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been linked with an increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. Purpose: To complete a meta-analysis of studies examining the association between AF and cognitive impairment. Data Sources: Search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases and hand search of article references. Study Selection: Prospective and nonprospective studies reporting adjusted risk estimates for the association between AF and cognitive impairment. Data Extraction: Two abstracters independently extracted data on study characteristics, risk estimates, methods of AF and outcome ascertainment, and methodological quality. Data Synthesis: Twenty-one studies were included in the metaanalysis. Atrial fibrillation was significantly associated with a higher risk for cognitive impairment in patients with first-ever or recurrent stroke (relative risk [RR], 2.70 [95% CI, 1.82 to 4.00]) and in a broader population including patients with or without a history of stroke (RR, 1.40 [CI, 1.19 to 1.64]). The association in the latter group remained significant independent proof of clinical stroke histrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia tory (RR, 1.34 [CI, 1.13 to 1.58]). However, there was significant heterogeneity among studies of the broader population (I2 69.4%). Limiting the analysis to prospective studies yielded similar results (RR, 1.36 [CI, 1.12 to 1.65]). Restricting the analysis to studies of dementia eliminated the significant heterogeneity (P = 0.137) but did not alter the pooled estimate substantially (RR, 1.38 [CI, 1.22 to 1.56]). Limitations: There is an inherent bias because of confounding variables in observational studies. There was significant heterogeneity among included studies. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that AF is associated with a higher risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, with or without a history of clinical stroke. Further studies are required to elucidate the association between AF and subtypes of dementia as well as the cause of cognitive impairment.

Embase,Mental health services for black and minority ethnic elders in the United Kingdom: A systematic review of innovative practice with service provision and policy implications,"Bhattacharyya, S.; Benbow, S.M.","ABSTRACT Background: The proportion of older people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups in the United Kingdom (UK) is increasing steadily as the population ages. The numbers with dementia, depression, and other mental health problems are predicted to increase. Government policy documents have highlighted gaps in services for BME elders and/or the need to develop culturally appropriate services, in order to prevent people from BME communities from becoming socially excluded and finding services hard to access. This paper reviews published examples of innovative services and key learning points from them. Method: A search was carried out on Pubmed, Medline, and Google Scholar for service developments aimed at BME elders in the UK. Sixteen relevant papers and reports were identified and were analysed to identify learning points and implications for clinical practice and policy. Results: Commissioning issues included were forward planning for continuing funding and mainstreaming versus specialist services. Provider management issues included were employing staff from the communities of interest, partnership, and removing language barriers. Provider service issues included were education for service provider staff on the needs of BME elders, making available information in relevant languages, building on carers' and users' experiences, and addressing the needs of both groups. Conclusion: A model for structuring understanding of the underutilisation of services by BME elders is suggested. The main emphasis in future should be to ensure that learning is shared, disseminated, and applied to the benefit of all communities across the whole of the UK and elsewhere. Person-centred care is beneficial to all service users.

Embase,Impact of Pharmacotherapy on Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis,"Roy, S.; Benedict, R.H.B.; Drake, A.S.; Weinstock-Guttman, B.","Cognitive impairment is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), adversely impacting many spheres of daily functioning. Yet the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for cognitive impairment in MS is unclear. Clinicians and patients alike would benefit from formal guidelines regarding effective management of cognitive symptoms. We reviewed the background on the measurement, pathophysiology and risk factors for cognitive dysfunction in MS, and then examined the published clinical trials of pharmacotherapy, including both disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and symptom-management therapies (SMTs). Our review of DMTs revealed only a single well-designed, randomized, controlled trial where intramuscular interferon (IFN)-Î_1a, administered once weekly, was compared with placebo. The results showed significant benefits in terms of cognitive processing speed and memory. Less convincing but promising data have shown the potential benefits of IFN-Î_1b and natalizumab. The literature on SMTs is replete with placebo-controlled, single-centre studies, with a failure to replicate initially promising results. The results for SMTs such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and psychostimulants are mixed. Some encouraging data show promise but not to a threshold of indication for standard clinical use. Numerous methodological factors hamper research in this area. Acknowledging the lack of firm conclusions, we argue that all DMTs are likely to benefit cognition and that, if otherwise safe, SMTs with some empirical support may be attempted at the discretion of the treating clinician. We offer some guidance on the assessment and monitoring of cognitive function to inform off-license treatment of cognitive impairment in MS patients.",2016,,CNS Drugs,30,3,209-225,,10.1007/s40263-016-0319-6,,#265,Roy 2016

Embase,Evidence to Consider Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for the Treatment of Early Alzheimerâ€™s Disease,"Saavedra, J.M.","Alzheimerâ€™s disease is the most frequent type of dementia and diagnosed late in the progression of the illness when irreversible brain tissue loss has already occurred. For this reason, treatments have been ineffective. It is imperative to find novel therapies ameliorating modifiable risk factors (hypertension, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and traumatic brain injury) and effective against early pathogenic mechanisms including alterations in cerebral blood flow leading to poor oxygenation and decreased access to nutrients, impaired glucose metabolism, chronic inflammation, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) fulfill these requirements. ARBs are directly neuroprotective against early injury factors in neuronal, astrocyte, microglia, and cerebrovascular endothelial cell cultures. ARBs protect cerebral blood flow and reduce injury to the blood brain barrier and neurological and cognitive loss in animal models of brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. These compounds are clinically effective against major risk factors for Alzheimerâ€™s disease: hypertension, stroke, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and ameliorate age-dependent cognitive loss. Controlled studies on hypertensive patients, open trials, case reports, and database meta-analysis indicate significant therapeutic effects of ARBs in Alzheimerâ€™s disease. ARBs are safe compounds, widely used to treat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in humans, and although they reduce hypertension, they do not affect blood pressure in normotensive individuals. Overall, there is sufficient evidence to consider long-term controlled clinical studies with ARBs in patients suffering from established risk factors, in patients with early cognitive loss, or in normal individuals when reliable biomarkers of Alzheimerâ€™s disease risk are identified.",2016,,Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology,36,2,259-279,,10.1007/s10571-015-0327-y,,#262,Saavedra 2016

The aim of this review was to determine whether environmental and lifestyle factors are associated with risk for non-autosomal dominant degenerative and vascular YOD. Academic databases were searched to March 2015 for studies assessing the impact of modifiable factors (e.g. education, cardiovascular illness, psychiatric illness, alcohol use) in participants under 65Â years at symptom onset. Cardiovascular illness, traumatic brain injury, psychiatric illness, heavy alcohol use and estrogen-related factors were identified as potential risk factors for YOD. Evidence for education, childhood development, smoking and heavy metal exposure was inconsistent or of poor quality. A doseâ€“response relationship was found between cumulative and/or increasing severity of exposure and risk for YOD. Environmental and lifestyle risk factors may be relevant to YOD, particularly with severe or cumulative exposure.

Embase,HDL-cholesterol and apolipoproteins in relation to dementia,"Koch, M.; Jensen, M.K.","Purpose of review Dementia is a major cause of disability and institutionalization. Apart from age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, there are currently no established, clinically relevant, noninvasive markers of dementia. We conducted a literature search of recent observational epidemiological studies evaluating the relevance of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoproteins as biomarkers of future and prevalent risk of dementia. Recent findings HDL-C and apolipoproteins, such as apoE have been suggested to play important roles in brain function and have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease in observational studies. However, findings have been inconsistent, especially across study designs. In recent years, modern proteomic approaches have enabled the investigation of further apolipoproteins involved in the deposition and clearance of Î_-amyloid, a determining factor for subsequent neurodegeneration. Summary Associations in cross-sectional studies are not always indicative of a prospective relationship. Large studies find that plasma HDL-C and apoE are inversely associated with dementia. Higher apoJ levels might be a marker of prevalent dementia, but were not associated with risk of future dementia. The investigation of HDL-C and apolipoproteins in relation to dementia represents an area of opportunity. Additional prospective studies that account for potential confounding factors and that explore potential effect modifiers such as APOE genotype and sex are needed to fully investigate the potential of these noninvasive measures in disease prediction.",2016,,Current Opinion in Lipidology,27,1,76-87,,10.1097/MOL.0000000000000257,,#260,Koch 2016

Methods: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of case-control studies examining the levels of cortisol, ACTH, CRH levels. Systematic review of stress reactivity, genetic, molecular and neuroimaging studies related to HPA axis activity in BD. Results: Forty-one studies were included in the meta-analyses. BD was associated with significantly increased levels of cortisol (basal and post-dexamethasone) and ACTH, but not of CRH. In the meta-regression, case-control differences in cortisol levels were positively associated with the manic phase (p = 0.005) and participants' age (p = 0.08), and negatively with antipsychotics use (p = 0.001). Reviewed studies suggest that BD is associated with abnormalities of stress-related molecular pathways in several brain areas. Variants of HPA axis-related genes seem not associated with a direct risk of developing BD, but with different clinical presentations. Also, studies on unaffected relatives suggest that HPA axis dysregulation is not an endophenotype of BD, but seems related to environmental risk factors, such as childhood trauma. Progressive HPA axis dysfunction is a putative mechanism that might underlie the clinical and cognitive deterioration of patients with BD. Conclusions: BD is associated with dysfunction of HPA axis activity, with important pathophysiological implications.

It is well established that neural plasticity, such as the ability of the postnatal hippocampus to continuously generate newly functional neurons throughout life, a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), can be modulated not only by pharmacological agents, physical exercise, and environmental enrichment, but also by ""nutraceutical"" agents. In this review we focus on resveratrol, a phenol and phytoalexin found in the skin of grapes and red berries, as well as in nuts. Resveratrol has been reported to have antioxidant and antitumor properties, but its effects as a neural plasticity inducer are still debated. The current review examines recent evidence implicating resveratrol in regulating hippocampal neural plasticity and in mitigating the effects of various disorders and diseases on this important brain structure. Overall, findings show that resveratrol can improve cognition and mood and enhance hippocampal plasticity and AHN; however, some studies report opposite effects, with resveratrol inhibiting aspects of AHN.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: PubMed from 1966 to 23 November 2009. Study selection: Prospective longitudinal studies that used magnetic resonance imaging and assessed the impact of white matter hyperintensities on risk of incident stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and death, and, for the meta-analysis, studies that provided risk estimates for a categorical measure of white matter hyperintensities, assessing the impact of these lesions on risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Data extraction: Population studied, duration of follow-up, method used to measure white matter hyperintensities, definition of the outcome, and measure of the association of white matter hyperintensities with the outcome. Data synthesis: 46 longitudinal studies evaluated the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke (n=12), cognitive decline (n=19), dementia (n=17), and death (n=10). 22 studies could be included in a meta-analysis (nine of stroke, nine of dementia, eight of death). White matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 4.4), dementia (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and death (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7). An association of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline in global cognitive performance, executive function, and processing speed was also suggested. Conclusion: White matter hyperintensities predict an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Therefore white matter hyperintensities indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events when identified as part of diagnostic investigations, and support their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting.

Moreover, patients who had experienced delirium were also at increased risk of institutionalization (7 studies; average follow-up, 14.6 months; 176/527 patients [33.4%] with delirium and 219/2052 controls [10.7%]; odds ratio [OR], 2.41 [95% CI, 1.77-3.29]; I2, 0%) and dementia (2 studies; average follow-up, 4.1 years; 35/56 patients [62.5%] with delirium and 15/185 controls [8.1%]; OR, 12.52 [95% CI, 1.86-84.21]; I2, 52.4%). The sensitivity, trim-and-fill, and secondary analyses with unadjusted high-quality risk estimates stratified according to the study characteristics confirmed the robustness of these results. Conclusion: This meta-analysis provides evidence that delirium in elderly patients is associated with poor outcome independent of important confounders, such as age, sex, comorbid illness or illness severity, and baseline dementia.

The sequencing of the human genome has identified more than 400 putative ion channels, but only a fraction of these have been cloned and functionally tested. The widespread tissue distribution of ion channels, coupled with the plethora of physiological consequences of their opening and closing, makes ion-channel-targeted drug discovery highly compelling. However, despite some important drugs in clinical use today, as a class, ion channels remain underexploited in drug discovery and many existing drugs are poorly selective with significant toxicities or suboptimal efficacy. This Perspective seeks to review the ion channel family, its structural and functional features, and the diseases that are known to be modulated by members of the family.

Embase,"Prevalence, presentation and prognosis of delirium in older people in the population, at home and in long term care: A review","De Lange, E.; Verhaak, P.F.M.; Van Der Meer, K.","Objective The aim of this study is to provide an overview of prevalence, symptoms, risk factors and prognosis of delirium in primary care and institutionalized long-term care. Design The method used in this study is a systematic PubMed search and literature review. Results The prevalence of delirium in the population among the elderly aged 65+ years is 1-2%. Prevalence rises with age: 10% among a ""general"" population aged 85+ years. Prevalence rises up to 22% in populations with higher percentages of demented elder. In long-term care, prevalence ranges between 1.4% and 70%, depending on diagnostic criteria and on the prevalence of dementia. There is a significant increase of the risk of delirium with age and cognitive decline in all groups. Concerning prognosis, most studies agree that older people who previously experienced delirium have a higher risk of dementia and a higher mortality rate. Population and long-term care studies show the same tendency. Conclusions Delirium in a non-selected population aged 65+ years is uncommon. However, prevalence rises very quickly in selected older groups. Primary care doctors should be aware of a relatively high risk of delirium among the elderly in long-term care, those older than 85 years and those with dementia.

Embase,The global prevalence of dementia: A systematic review and metaanalysis,"Prince, M.; Bryce, R.; Albanese, E.; Wimo, A.; Ribeiro, W.; Ferri, C.P.","Background: The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning. Methods: In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged â‰¥60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. Results: Age-standardized prevalence for those aged â‰¥60 years varied in a narrow band, 5%-7% in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5%), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2%-4%). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58% of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63% in 2030 and 71% in 2050. Conclusion: The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression).

Embase,"Brain cholesterol metabolism, oxysterols, and dementia","Hughes, T.M.; Rosano, C.; Evans, R.W.; Kuller, L.H.","Cholesterol metabolism is implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid production in the brain. While brain cholesterol cannot be measured directly in vivo, the oxysterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), is the predominant metabolite of brain cholesterol and can be measured in the blood. The aim of this review is to evaluate plasma 24-OHC as a potential biomarker of AD risk and discuss factors related to its levels in the brain and blood. This systematic review examines studies published between 1950 and June 2012 that examined the relationship between plasma 24-OHC, cognition, brain structure, and dementia using the following key words ('24S-hydroxycholesterol' or '24-hydroxycholesterol') and ('Brain' or 'Cognitive'). We found a total of 28 studies of plasma 24-OHC and neurodegenerative disease, including a subset of 12 that used dementia as a clinical endpoint. These studies vary in the direction of the observed associations. Results suggest plasma 24-OHC may be higher in the early stages of cognitive impairment and lower in more advanced stages of AD when compared to cognitively normal controls. Measures of 24-OHC in the blood may be an important potential marker for cholesterol metabolism in the brain and risk of AD. Further studies of plasma 24-OHC and dementia must account for the stage of disease, establish the temporal trends in oxysterol concentrations, and employ neuroimaging modalities to assess the structural and metabolic changes occurring in the brain prior to the onset of cognitive impairment.

Drugs are often involved as causative factor. Nevertheless, few data are available about the prevalence of OH and its relationship with drugs in olders. Objectives: To review data about (i) the prevalence and characteristics of OH in older patients; and (ii) the relationship between OH and drugs. Methods: Review of publications from Ovid (PubMed) from 1980 to May 2011 using the following key words: ""orthostatic hypotension"" combined with ""elderly"" or equivalent for the analysis of prevalence (first search) and ""orthostatic hypotension"" combined with ""drugs"" or equivalent to assess the relationship between OH and drugs (second search). Results: Fifty-one publications (of which 14 with original data) were retrieved from the prevalence search, 31 for the second search (8 with original data: 7 retrospective studies and 1 prospective cohort study) and 12 reviews or experts opinions. Prevalence of OH varies according to the characteristics of the subjects, the settings of the studies, and the procedures of blood pressure measurement. In acute geriatrics units, two studies reported a prevalence of over 30% and one study mentioned that 68% of the patients presented with at least one episode during the day. OH was associated with several geriatric problems: gait disorders, balance disorders, falls, cerebral hypoperfusion, transient ischemic attacks, cognitive impairment, acute myocardial infarct and systolic hypertension. OH can also be asymptomatic or with atypical presentation: falls, gait disorders and confusion. Psychotropic agents (antipsychotics, sedatives, antidepressants), and cardiovascular drugs (antihypertensive agents, vasodilators, diuretics) were associated with OH. Discussion: If the hypothesis of causality between drug treatment and OH is confirmed, the identification of the involved drugs could be of value for the prevention of OH and its complications. In this context, the Working Group Pharmacology Pharmacotherapy and Pharmaceutical Care of the Belgian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics proposes to conduct a multicentre study to assess the prevalence of OH in Belgian acute geriatrics units and its relationship with drugs.",2013,,Acta Clinica Belgica,68,2,107-112,,10.2143/ACB.3215,,#83,Pepersack 2013

Persons ingesting a Mediterranean-type diet appear to be less likely to develop AD. Epidemiologically, food combinations rich in antioxidant vitamins reduced the risk of AD. Combination formulas (eg, Souvenaid) appear to have small effects on cognition. B-vitamin supplements were mostly disappointing with inconsistent findings, except in countries where bread is not fortified with folate. They were generally negative, as were studies investigating omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Based on this review, a Mediterranean diet and/or a combination supplement, such as Souvenaid, appear to be the most beneficial approaches with the least possible adverse effects to slowing the progression of AD.

The use of statins in the prevention and treatment of AD is poorly explored. The aim of this work was, therefore, to perform a review of studies on the efficacy and safety of statins in the prevention as well as treatment of AD. Methods and Findings Medline and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews search was performed for original research articles published in English language in which participants received any type of statins for at least 6 months and evaluated for their cognitive changes. Selected articles were grouped into two, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, and meta-analyzed separately. Thirteen studies identified, 4 RCTs including 1153 AD patients with trial period ranging from 26 to 72 weeks and 9 observational studies including 21,819 study participants with follow up period of up to 12 years. The 4 RCTs assessed change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- consisting of the cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and when the results of each studies were combined there was no significant difference in ADAS-Cog between the statin and placebo group [Mean difference = -0.57, 95% CI, -1.39, 0.25, p=0.17]. Four of the 9 observational studies provided computed effect sizes in the form of Hazard ratio (HR) and common HR were computed and showed that statins had significant protective effect against AD [HR=0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.542, 0.882, p=0.003]. Three of the 9 observational studies were also combined for their Odds ratio (OR) and they showed that statins were protective against AD [OR=0.447, 95% CI, 0.299, 0.668, p=000]. Treatment related adverse effects were similar between statin and placebo [OR=2.84, 95% CI, 0.41, 19.69, p=0.29]. Conclusion Though observational studies have shown statins' protective effect against AD, there is insufficient evidence to recommend statins for the treatment of AD, as RCTs failed to show significant efficacy.

Embase,Effectiveness of nootropic drugs with cholinergic activity in treatment of cognitive deficit: A review,"Colucci, L.; Bosco, M.; Ziello, A.R.; Rea, R.; Amenta, F.; Fasanaro, A.M.","Nootropics represent probably the first ""smart drugs"" used for the treatment of cognitive deficits. The aim of this paper is to verify, by a systematic analysis of the literature, the effectiveness of nootropics in this indication. The analysis was limited to nootropics with cholinergic activity, in view of the role played by acetylcholine in learning and memory. Acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter identified in the history of neuroscience and is the main neurotransmitter of the peripheral, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. We conducted a systematic review of the literature for the 5-year period 2006-2011. From the data reported in the literature, it emerges that nootropics may be an effective alternative for strengthening and enhancing cognitive performance in patients with a range of pathologies. Although nootropics, and specifically the cholinergic precursors, already have a long history behind them, according to recent renewal of interest, they still seem to have a significant therapeutic role. Drugs with regulatory indications for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, often have transient effects in dementia disorders. Nootropics with a cholinergic profile and documented clinical effectiveness in combination with cognate drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors or alone in patients who are not suitable for these inhibitors should be taken into account and evaluated further.

Embase,Genetic heritability of ischemic stroke and the contribution of previously reported candidate gene and genomewide associations,"Bevan, S.; Traylor, M.; Adib-Samii, P.; Malik, R.; Paul, N.L.M.; Jackson, C.; Farrall, M.; Rothwell, P.M.; Sudlow, C.; Dichgans, M.; Markus, H.S.","Background and Purpose: The contribution of genetics to stroke risk, and whether this differs for different stroke subtypes, remains uncertain. Genomewide complex trait analysis allows heritability to be assessed from genomewide association study (GWAS) data. Previous candidate gene studies have identified many associations with stoke but whether these are important requires replication in large independent data sets. GWAS data sets provide a powerful resource to perform replication studies. Methods: We applied genomewide complex trait analysis to a GWAS data set of 3752 ischemic strokes and 5972 controls and determined heritability for all ischemic stroke and the most common subtypes: large-vessel disease, small-vessel disease, and cardioembolic stroke. By systematic review we identified previous candidate gene and GWAS associations with stroke and previous GWAS associations with related cardiovascular phenotypes (myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and carotid intima-media thickness). Fifty associations were identified. Results: For all ischemic stroke, heritability was 37.9%. Heritability varied markedly by stroke subtype being 40.3% for large-vessel disease and 32.6% for cardioembolic but lower for small-vessel disease (16.1%). No previously reported candidate gene was significant after rigorous correction for multiple testing. In contrast, 3 loci from related cardiovascular GWAS studies were significant: PHACTR1 in large-vessel disease (P=2.63e-6), PITX2 in cardioembolic stroke (P=4.78e-8), and ZFHX3 in cardioembolic stroke (P=5.50e -7). Conclusions: There is substantial heritability for ischemic stroke, but this varies for different stroke subtypes. Previous candidate gene associations contribute little to this heritability, but GWAS studies in related cardiovascular phenotypes are identifying robust associations. The heritability data, and data from GWAS, suggest detecting additional associations will depend on careful stroke subtyping.

Embase,The therapeutic value of yoga in neurological disorders,"Mishra, S.K.; Singh, P.; Bunch, S.; Zhang, R.","Background: The ancient mind and body healing methods of yoga recently sparked fervor in the scientific community as an alternative and complementary means of therapy. Since the World Health Organization officially began promoting yoga in developing countries in 1978, yoga has been cited for its therapeutic potential and has been widely recognized in Western culture. However, as an increasing number of people practice yoga for remedial purposes, researchers raise two important questions: 1) Is yoga a valid complementary management and rehabilitation treatment modality 2) What conditions show promise of treatment with this intervention. Objective: This review article uses comprehensive scientific, evidence-based studies to analyze the efficacy of various basic and applied aspects of yoga in disease prevention and health promotion. It specifically intends to expose the effects of yoga in neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, peripheral nervous system disease, and fibromyalgia. Materials and Methods: Information was gathered from various resources including PubMed, Ovid, MD-Consult, USC, and U.C.L.A. libraries. Studies were selected and reviewed on the basis of sample size, control, randomization, double-blinding, and statistical analysis of results. Results: The pratice of yoga and meditation demonstrates statistically encouraging physiological and psychological improvements in the aforementioned neurological disorders. However, there were certain flaws and inadequacies in the study designs employed to evaluate the same. A critical analysis of these studies is presented. Conclusions: With the aim to focus attention on this widespread yet largely unexamined treatment modality, this paper seeks to provide direction and support for further research necessary to validate yoga as an integrative, alternative, and complementary therapy.",2012,,Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology,15,4,247-254,,10.4103/0972-2327.104328,,#66,Mishra 2012
Embase,Time to onset of efficacy in fracture reduction with current anti-osteoporosis treatments,"Inderjeeth, C.A.; Chan, K.; Kwan, K.; Lai, M.","Early prevention of future fracture is an important goal in those at risk. A similar 3-year fracture efficacy is reported for most osteoporosis agents. Onset of fracture efficacy may be useful to help tailor treatment based on risk. We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature for onset of fracture efficacy data on the commonly prescribed osteoporosis treatments. All papers were reviewed independently by at least two reviewers for onset of efficacy for morphometric vertebral fracture (MVF), clinical vertebral fracture (CVF), nonvertebral fracture (NVF), hip fracture, and any clinical fracture (ACF). Alendronate is reported to reduce multiple CVF by 6 months; all CVF, NVF, and multiple ACF by 12 months; and all ACF and hip fracture by 18 months. Ibandronate is reported to reduce MVF by 12 months and NVF by 36 months. Raloxifene is reported to reduce CVF by 3-6 months and NVF by 36 months. Risedronate is reported to reduce CVF and NVF by 6 months, and hip fracture by 12 months. Strontium ranelate is reported to reduce MVF, CVF, NVF, and ACF by 12 months, and hip fracture by 36 months. Zoledronic acid is reported to reduce MVF, CVF, and ACF by 12 months, NVF by 24 months, and hip fracture by 36 months. Although direct comparisons are limited, based on the available literature, risedronate, followed by alendronate, have the earliest onset of benefit across the range of fracture types.

Embase,Systematic reviews on behavioural and psychological symptoms in the older or demented population,"Van Der Linde, R.M.; Stephan, B.C.M.; Savva, G.M.; Dening, T.; Brayne, C.","Introduction. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPS) include depressive symptoms, anxiety, apathy, sleep problems, irritability, psychosis, wandering, elation and agitation, and are common in the non-demented and demented population. Methods. We have undertaken a systematic review of reviews to give a broad overview of the prevalence, course, biological and psychosocial associations, care and outcomes of BPS in the older or demented population, and highlight limitations and gaps in existing research. Embase and Medline were searched for systematic reviews using search terms for BPS, dementia and ageing. Results: Thirty-six reviews were identified. Most investigated the prevalence or course of symptoms, while few reviewed the effects of BPS on outcomes and care. BPS were found to occur in non-demented, cognitively impaired and demented people, but reported estimates vary widely. Biological factors associated with BPS in dementia include genetic factors, homocysteine levels and vascular changes. Psychosocial factors increase risk of BPS; however, across studies and between symptoms findings are inconsistent. BPS have been associated with burden of care, caregiver's general health and caregiver depression scores, but findings are limited regarding institutionalisation, quality of life and disease outcome. Conclusions: Limitations of reviews include a lack of high quality reviews, particularly of BPS other than depression. Limitations of original studies include heterogeneity in study design particularly related to measurement of BPS, level of cognitive impairment, population characteristics and participant recruitment. It is our recommendation that more high quality reviews, including all BPS, and longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes that use frequently cited instruments to measure BPS are undertaken. A better understanding of the risk factors and course of BPS will inform prevention, treatment and management and possibly improve quality of life for the patients and their carers.

Embase,Treating patients with schizophrenia deficit with erythropoietin?,"Fond, G.; MacGregor, A.; Attal, J.; Larue, A.; Brittner, M.; Ducasse, D.; Capdevielle, D.","This systematic review summarizes and critically appraises the literature on the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) in schizophrenia patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the potential of its use in this disease. EPO is mainly known for its regulatory activity in the synthesis of erythrocytes and is frequently used in treatment of chronic anemia. This cytokine, however, has many other properties, some of which may improve the symptoms of psychiatric illness. The review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Three databases (Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were searched combining the search terms 'erythropoietin AND (psychotic disorders OR schizophrenia)'. Seventy-eight studies were included in qualitative synthesis, a meta-analytic approach being prohibited. The findings suggest that several EPO cerebral potential properties may be relevant for schizophrenia treatment, such as neurotransmission regulation, neuroprotection, modulation of inflammation, effects on blood-brain barrier permeability, effects on oxidative stress and neurogenesis. Several potentially detrimental side-effects of EPO therapy, such as increased risk of thrombosis, cancer, increased metabolic rate and mean arterial blood pressure leading to cerebral ischemia could severely limit or halt the use of EPO. Overall, because the available data are inconclusive, further efforts in this field are warranted. Â© 2012 The Authors.

Embase,A brief review of practical preoperative cognitive screening tools,"Stephen Long, L.; Shapiro, W.A.; Leung, J.M.","Purpose Preoperative cognitive impairment is associated with the development of postoperative delirium, a common and consequential complication of major surgery in older patients. Screening for cognitive impairment should become a routine part of the preoperative evaluation of older patients; however, its implementation is hampered by limited clinical time and resources. The objective of this review was to identify cognitive screening tools that could be easily incorporated into the evaluation of older patients before major surgery. Search strategy Using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, we searched PubMed over a 15-year period for short and simple cognitive screening tools. In addition, we reviewed studies that examined these cognitive screening tools in a perioperative environment. Search results We identified six cognitive screening tools that could each be administered in 2.5 min or less. Among the tools, sensitivity for cognitive impairment ranged from 79-99%, while specificity ranged from 70-98%. Only one (Mini-Cog) of the six tools we identified had been tested in a perioperative environment. Conclusions Incorporating a cognitive screening assessment into the preoperative evaluation of older patients is feasible. More research is needed to validate cognitive screening tools in the perioperative setting.

Embase,"Prevalence, associated factors and treatment of sleep problems in adults with intellectual disability: A systematic review","Van de Wouw, E.; Evenhuis, H.M.; Echteld, M.A.","In people with intellectual disability (ID), impaired sleep is common. Life expectancy has increased in this group, and it is known that in general population sleep deteriorates with aging. Therefore the aims of this systematic review were to examine how sleep problems are defined in research among adults and older people with ID, and to collect information on the prevalence, associated factors and treatment of sleep problems in this population. PubMed, EMBase, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched for studies published between January 1990 and August 2011. All empirical studies covering sleep problems in adults with ID were included, and assessed on quality (level of evidence), using a slightly modified version of the SIGN-50 methodology checklist for cohort studies. Of 50 studies that were included for systematic review, one was of high quality, 14 were well conducted, 14 were well conducted but with a high risk of bias, and 21 were non-analytical. The reported estimated prevalence rates of sleep problems in adults with ID ranged from 8.5% to 34.1%. A prevalence of 9.2% was reported for significant sleep problems. Sleep problems were associated with the following factors: challenging behavior; respiratory disease; visual impairment; psychiatric conditions; and using psychotropic, antiepileptic and/or antidepressant medication. Little information was found on older people specifically. Two studies reported treatment effects on sleep problems in larger populations; their findings suggest that non-pharmaceutical interventions are beneficial. Research on the prevalence, associated factors and treatment of sleep problems in adults and older people with ID has mainly focused on subjectively derived data. The definitions used to describe a sleep problem are not uniform, and associations are mainly described as correlations. In order to give recommendations for clinical practice further research is needed, involving objective measurements and multivariate analysis.

Embase,Omega 3 fatty acids and cognitive health in older people,"Dangour, A.D.; Andreeva, V.A.; Sydenham, E.; Uauy, R.","Oily fish and other sources of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPs) have been proposed as protective against dementia and age related cognitive impairment. The basic mechanisms underlying these proposed benefits have been postulated and experimental studies supporting the plausibility of the putative effects have been published. Observational epidemiological and case control studies also largely support a protective role of fish consumption on cognitive function with advancing age, albeit with important unexplained heterogeneity in findings. In this review we report the findings of the latest Cochrane review on the benefits of n-3 LCP supplementation on cognitive function among cognitively healthy older people and expand the review by including trials conducted with individuals with prevalent poor cognitive function or dementia. We identified seven relevant trials, four among cognitively healthy older people, and three among individuals with pre-existing cognitive decline or dementia, and overall conclude that there is no evidence to support the routine use of n-3 LCPs supplements for the prevention, or amelioration, of cognitive decline in later life. We identified several challenges in the design of intervention studies for the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline in older people that require careful consideration especially in recruitment and retention in long-term trials. Whether the lack of agreement in findings from mechanistic and observational data and from intervention studies reflects a real absence of benefit on cognitive function from n-3 LCP supplementation, or whether it reflects intrinsic limitations in the design of published studies remains open to question.

Embase,Medication adherence in older adults with cognitive impairment: A systematic evidence-based review,"Campbell, N.L.; Boustani, M.A.; Skopelja, E.N.; Gao, S.; Unverzagt, F.W.; Murray, M.D.","Background: Cognitive impairment challenges the ability to adhere to the complex medication regimens needed to treat multiple medical problems in older adults. Objective: Our aim was to conduct a systematic evidence-based review to identify barriers to medication adherence in cognitively impaired older adults and interventions aimed at improving medication adherence. Methods: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, GoogleDocs, and CINAHL for articles published between 1966 and February 29, 2012 was performed. Studies included older adults with a diagnosis of cognitive impairment of any degree (mild cognitive impairment or mild, moderate, or severe dementia). To identify barriers to adherence, we reviewed observational studies. To identify relevant interventions, we reviewed clinical trials targeting medication adherence in cognitively impaired older adults. We excluded studies lacking a measure of medication adherence or lacking an assessment of cognitive function, case reports or series, reviews, and those focusing on psychiatric disorders or infectious diseases. Population demographics, baseline cognitive function, medication adherence methods, barriers to adherence, and prospective intervention methodologies were extracted. Results: The initial search identified 594 articles. Ten studies met inclusion criteria for barriers to adherence and three met inclusion criteria for interventional studies. Unique barriers to adherence included understanding new directions, living alone, scheduling medication administration into the daily routine, using potentially inappropriate medications, and uncooperative patients. Two studies evaluated reminder systems and showed no benefit in a small group of participants. One study improved adherence through telephone and televideo reminders at each dosing interval. The results of the review are limited by reviewing only published articles, missing barriers or interventions due to lack of subgroup analysis, study selection and extraction completed by 1 reviewer, and articles with at least an abstract published in English. Conclusions: The few studies identified limit the assessment of barriers to medication adherence in the cognitively impaired population. Successful interventions suggest that frequent human communication as reminder systems are more likely to improve adherence than nonhuman reminders.

Embase,The older patient with heart failure: High risk for frailty and cognitive impairment,"Harkness, K.; Heckman, G.A.; McKelvie, R.S.","Managing older heart failure (HF) patients can be complicated by both cardiac and noncardiac conditions. Over the past 20 years, care for HF patients has become more complex, with a rising proportion of older people living with HF. In particular, cognitive impairment (CI) and frailty often coexist with HF in the elderly. With the prevalence of HF, frailty and cognitive impairment rising with age, the simultaneous occurrence of at least two of these conditions in the same individual will become more frequent. The presence of frailty and/or cognitive impairment in older people with HF is independently associated with worse clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of frailty and cognitive impairment in older HF patients. Specifically, this article describes the epidemiology of these conditions in HF patients, outlines potential underlying mechanisms, highlights relevant screening tools and reviews relevant clinical implications.

Embase,Asenapine: A Clinical Review of a Second-Generation Antipsychotic,"Stoner, S.C.; Pace, H.A.","Background: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are both prevalent types of psychiatric illness in the United States. As second-generation antipsychotics have become a more viable first-line treatment option, their use has been associated with a new era of adverse events (AEs), most notably metabolic and cardiovascular concerns. Although treatment options for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have arguably improved, there continues to be a need for medications that achieve and maintain desired efficacy with minimal AEs. Objectives: This article serves as a comprehensive review of the pharmacologic profile of the second-generation antipsychotic asenapine, as well as a review of its efficacy and safety profiles based on the findings from clinical trials in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Methods: Searches of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and IDIS were conducted (January 1996 to November 2011) to identify clinical studies and other primary literature sources with the following search terms: . asenapine, bipolar disorder, antipsychotic, psychosis, dopamine, and . schizophrenia. Only studies of asenapine and placebo and/or active-comparator arms were included. Results: The literature search yielded 67 unique articles, including review articles, which were excluded. The efficacy of asenapine was reported in 3 clinical studies in patients with schizophrenia, 1 each in acute and long-term settings, measured as significant changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores over 6 and 52 weeks. Asenapine also had reported efficacy in the prevention of relapse in schizophrenia during a 26-week extension study. In addition, efficacy of asenapine was reported in 2 studies in acute mania as well as extension phases of both 9 and 40 weeks, as determined by significant changes in Young Mania Rating Scale scores. The most commonly reported AEs in these studies were somnolence (13%-24%), extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) (7%-12%), and dizziness (11%). Conclusions: The findings from multiple studies have suggested that asenapine is efficacious in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. Asenapine has reported long-term efficacy for this indication and the potential to reduce the incidence of relapse. Asenapine efficacy was also reported in the treatment of acute manic or mixed states associated with bipolar I disorder. Asenapine had an acceptable safety profile across the different disease states studied, although it was not devoid of metabolic and EPS-related AEs.

Embase,A review of orthostatic blood pressure regulation and its association with mood and cognition,"Perlmuter, L.C.; Sarda, G.; Casavant, V.; O'Hara, K.; Hindes, M.; Knott, P.T.; Mosnaim, A.D.","Aims: This paper will review literature that examines the psychological and neuropsychological correlates of orthostatic blood pressure regulation. Results: The pattern of change in systolic blood pressure in response to the shift from supine to upright posture reflects the adequacy of orthostatic regulation. Orthostatic integrity involves the skeletal muscle pump, neurovascular compensation, neurohumoral effects and cerebral flow regulation. Various physiological states and disease conditions may disrupt these mechanisms. Clinical and subclinical orthostatic hypotension has been associated with impaired cognitive function, decreased effort, reduced motivation and increased hopelessness as well as dementia, diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, inadequate blood pressure regulation in response to orthostasis has been linked to increased depression and anxiety as well as to intergenerational behavioral sequalae. Conclusions: Identifying possible causes and consequences of subclinical and clinical OH are critical in improving quality of life for both children and older adults.

Embase,The Neuropsychiatric Complications of Glucocorticoid Use: Steroid Psychosis Revisited,"Dubovsky, A.N.; Arvikar, S.; Stern, T.A.; Axelrod, L.","Background: Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed for a variety of diseases and are known to cause neuropsychiatric as well as somatic side effects. Objective: This article will review the incidence, clinical characteristics, course, and treatment of neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids. Methods: We performed a literature review of the neuropsychiatric complications of glucocorticoids using the PubMed database. Results: The neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids involve affective, behavioral, and cognitive manifestations. Serious neuropsychiatric effects occur in about 6% of patients who receive steroids. Although the effects of glucocorticoids are unpredictable, the administered dose is the most significant risk factor for the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Dosage reduction typically results in clinical recovery. Although evidence from controlled trials is sparse, administration of antipsychotics or mood stabilizers may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of neuropsychiatric effects of steroids. Conclusion: The neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids are more diverse than the often-misleading term"";steroid psychosis"" suggests. This label should be limited to those patients who are truly psychotic, and specific designations applied to patients with other effects. The adverse neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids remain poorly characterized in the literature (which consists largely of case reports and case series). Reliable risk factors (other than dose) that identify individuals at risk are lacking; guidelines for the prevention of neuropsychiatric effects are not evidence-based. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to elucidate the optimal management of glucocorticoid-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Embase,"Leisure activities, cognition and dementia","Wang, H.-X.; Xu, W.; Pei, J.-J.","Accumulated evidence shows that leisure activities have a positive impact on cognitive function and dementia. This review aimed to systematically summarize the current evidence on this topic taking into account the limitations of the studies and biological plausibility for the underlying mechanisms linking cognition, dementia and leisure activities, with special attention on mental, physical and social activities. We included only longitudinal studies, with a follow-up time of at least 2. years, published in English from 1991 to March 2011 on leisure activities and cognition (n. = 29) or dementia (n = 23) and provided some evidence from intervention studies on the topic. A protective effect of mental activity on cognitive function has been consistently reported in both observational and interventional studies. The association of mental activity with the risk of dementia was robust in observational studies but inconsistent in clinical trials. The protective effect of physical activity on the risk of cognitive decline and dementia has been reported in most observational studies, but has been less evident in interventional studies. Current evidence concerning the beneficial effect of other types of leisure activities on the risk of dementia is still limited and results are inconsistent. For future studies it is imperative that the assessment of leisure activities is standardized, for example, the frequency, intensity, duration and the type of activity; and also that the cognitive test batteries and the definition of cognitive decline are harmonized/standardized. Further, well designed studies with long follow-up times are necessary. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease.

Embase,Diagnostic accuracy of 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) in dementia with Lewy bodies: A meta-analysis of published studies,"Papathanasiou, N.D.; Boutsiadis, A.; Dickson, J.; Bomanji, J.B.","Purpose: A systematic meta-analysis of published studies on the diagnostic accuracy of presynaptic dopaminergic imaging with 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Methods: We included (a) studies in which DaTSCAN was performed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty to differentiate between DLB and non-DLB dementia and (b) studies of patients with already established diagnoses of DLB, non-DLB dementia, or normalcy, against which the diagnostic accuracy of DaTSCAN was tested. We applied fixed-effects Mantel-Haenszel and hierarchical logistic regression models for meta-analysis of the diagnostic test's accuracy. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were estimated. Heterogeneity among studies was estimated by calculating the corresponding I2 statistic. We tested for publication or other bias by creating the respective funnel plot. Results: Four studies, with a total of 419 subjects, were judged to be suitable for meta-analysis. According to hierarchical models, the estimated pooled sensitivity of DaTSCAN in differentiating DLB versus no DLB was 86.5% [95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 72-94.1%], the specificity was 93.6% (95% CI: 88.5-96.6%), and the DOR was 94.2 (95% CI: 25.7-345). The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of overall DOR was calculated at 48.95 (95% CI: 26.16-91.59). There was some heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 45%), but this was not found statistically significant (Ï‡2 test for heterogeneity p value = 0.142). Funnel plot analysis showed no significant bias. Conclusion: Allowing for the small number of studies in the meta-analysis, our results showed high diagnostic accuracy of DaTSCAN in DLB diagnosis, especially in terms of specificity.

Embase,Review of cerebral microangiopathy and Alzheimer's disease: Relation between white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds,"Hommet, C.; Mondon, K.; Constans, T.; Beaufils, E.; Desmidt, T.; Camus, V.; Cottier, J.P.","Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is basically considered to be a neurodegenerative disorder, cerebrovascular disease is also involved. The role of vascular risk factors and vascular disease in the progression of AD remains incompletely understood. With the development of brain MRI, it is now possible to detect small-vessel disease, whose prevalence and severity increase with age. The first types of small-vessel disease to be described were white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). More recently, small areas of signal loss on T 2*-weighted images, also called microbleeds (MBs), have been reported. Cerebral MBs are focal deposits of hemosiderin that indicate prior microhemorrhages around small vessels, related to either ruptured atherosclerotic microvessels or amyloid angiopathy. Consequently, using brain MRI for the detection of microangiopathy may prove useful to improve our understanding of the impact of the vascular burden in AD pathology. The relationship between microangiopathy and the clinical course of AD or the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD remains questionable in terms of cognitive or affective symptoms, particularly if we consider MBs.

Embase,"Dementia, stroke, and vascular risk factors; a review","Sahathevan, R.; Brodtmann, A.; Donnan, G.A.","Interest in dementia has increased over the past few decades. Stroke is an important cause of cognitive problems. The term vascular cognitive impairment is now used to describe dementia attributed to stroke or deep white matter lesions detected on imaging. Although vascular cognitive impairment is increasingly diagnosed, Alzheimer's disease remains the most common dementia worldwide. The relationship between Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment is unclear, although there exists significant overlap, which prompts physicians to consider them opposite ends of a disease spectrum, rather than separate entities. There is also substantial evidence that stroke risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes; lipid disorders, etc. are independently associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests that these risk factors have a cumulative effect on Alzheimer's disease development but not on vascular cognitive impairment. This is more marked in Alzheimer's disease patients in the presence of the Îµ4 allelic variant of apolipoprotein E. How these risk factors increase the risk of dementia is largely unknown. Physicians must be aware that stroke causes dementia; that vascular risk factors appear to be independent risk factors in developing dementia, and that poststroke care must include cognitive assessment.

Furthermore, many issues concerning diagnosis, prediction and prevention of PHN need to be clarified in view of recent contributions. Objectives: To assess whether PHN may be better defined, predicted, treated and prevented in light of recent data, and whether available alternative or adjunctive therapies may improve pain relief in treatment recalcitrant PHN. Methods: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and protocols were searched; the search sources included PubMed, Cochrane Library, NICE, and DARE. More than 130 papers were selected and evaluated. Results: Diagnosis of PHN is essentially clinical, but it can be improved by resorting to the many tools available, including some practical and accessible questionnaires. Prediction of PHN can be now much more accurate, taking into consideration a few well validated clinical and anamnestic variables. Treatment of PHN is presently based on a well characterized array of drugs and drug associations, including, among others, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, opioids and many topical formulations. It is still unsatisfactory, however, in a substantial proportion of patients, especially those with many comorbidities and intense pain at herpes zoster (HZ) presentation, so that this frequent complication of HZ still strongly impacts on the quality of life of affected patients. Conclusion: Further efforts are needed to improve the management of PHN. Potentially relevant interventions may include early antiviral therapy of acute HZ, prevention of HZ by adult vaccination, as well as new therapeutic approaches for patients experiencing PHN.

Embase,Overview of studies related to geriatric syndrome in Taiwan,"Wu, C.-H.; Chang, C.-I.; Chen, C.-Y.","Geriatric syndrome has become one of the most important concepts in modern geriatric medicine. With the baby boomer generation in Taiwan are becoming old, it is important to gain a better understanding what have been done related to geriatric syndromes in Taiwan. Thus, the aim of the study is to overview the studies related to geriatric syndromes in Taiwan during the past two decades. Three English databases (Medline, PubMed, and PsycInfo) and two Chinese databases (Chinese Periodical Index and Chinese Journal Resources) were used to search for original studies related to geriatric syndrome with older Taiwanese participants. Studies published during the time period from January 1989 to February 2009 were included. A total of 255 studies were found. The number of published studies increased during the past decade (14 studies in 2001, 34 studies in 2004, and 51 studies during 2008-February 2009). There were 142 studies (55.7%) related to geriatric syndromes. Most of them were related with functional decline, disability, and fall (54 articles) and about cognitive function declines, dementia, delirium, and depression (49 articles). Furthermore, after reviewing 79 studies, which had reported risk/protective factors, six possible shared risk/protective factors were found: sex, education, age, daily living function, self-rated health, and chronic disease. It is encouraging to find out that studies related to geriatric syndromes are growing in number with expanding diversity in Taiwan. However, more studies are needed, especially those designed with a more comprehensive view of health and functioning about older people, to improve the understanding of geriatric syndromes in Taiwan.

Methods: Sensitivity to bias was explored using a central-birth-cohort model using data from 18 case-control studies obtained after a review of 494 reports on medical procedures and risk of CJD, systematic for the period January 1, 1989 to December 31, 2011. Results: The validity of the findings in these studies may have been undermined by: recall; control selection; exposure assessment in life-time periods of different duration, out of time-at-risk of effect, or asymmetry in case/control data; and confounding by concomitant blood transfusion at the time of surgery. For sporadic CJD (sCJD), a history of surgery or blood transfusion was associated with risk in some, but not all, recent studies at a â‰¥10 year lag time, when controls were longitudinally sampled. Space-time aggregation of surgical events was not seen. Surgery at early clinical onset might be overrepresented among cases. Neither surgical history nor blood transfusion unlabelled for donor status, dental treatments or endoscopic examinations were linked to variant CJD (vCJD). Conclusions: These results indicate the need for further research. Common challenges within these studies include access to and content of past medical/dental treatment records for diseases with long incubation periods. Â© 2012 S.

Embase,Efficacy and tolerability of a combination treatment of memantine and donepezil for alzheimer's disease: A literature review evidence,"Riverol, M.; Slachevsky, A.; LÃ_pez, O.L.","Introduction: Two types of drugs have been approved for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD): the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine. There is a growing interest to know whether the combination of these drugs is safe and if it adds any clinical benefit to patients. Objective: To systematically review published medical literature assessing the efficacy and tolerability of a combination treatment of memantine and donepezil in AD patients. Methods: We searched PubMed for English and Spanish-language literature, using the terms ""Alzheimer?s disease,"" ""cholinesterase inhibitors,"" ""donepezil,"" and ""memantine."" Our review focused on clinical trials and observational studies. Results: Eleven publications representing seven unique studies were selected for this review. Three were randomized double-blind, placebocontrolled trials and four were observational studies. Conclusions: Available data revealed that the combination of memantine and donepezil slowed down cognitive decline, prolonged functional independence, and improved behavioral symptoms in patients with moderate to severe AD. The long-term use of the dual therapy decreased the risk of nursing home admission. More longitudinal studies are needed to further examine the role of combined therapy in the management of AD patients.",2011,,European Neurological Journal,3,1,15-19,,,,#26,Riverol 2011
Embase,Cholesterol level and statin use in Alzheimer disease: I. Review of epidemiological and preclinical studies,"Shepardson, N.E.; Shankar, G.M.; Selkoe, D.J.","During the last 2 decades, evidence has accumulated that a high cholesterol level may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). With the global use of statins to treat hypercholesterolemia, this finding has led to the anticipation that statins could prove useful in treating or preventing AD. However, the results of work on this topic are inconsistent: some studies find beneficial effects, but other studies do not. In this first segment of a 2-part review, we examine the complex preclinical and clinical literature on cholesterol level and AD. First, we review epidemiological research on cholesterol level and the risk of AD and discuss the relevance of discrepancies among studies with regard to participants' age and clinical status. Second, we assess studies correlating cholesterol level with neuropathological AD type. The potential molecular mechanisms for the apparent adverse effects of cholesterol on the development of AD are then discussed. Third, we review preclinical studies of statin use and AD. Therefore, this first part of our review provides the background and rationale for investigating statins as potential therapeutic agents in patients with AD, the subject of the second part.

Embase,Neurostructural predictors of Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of VBM studies,"Ferreira, L.K.; Diniz, B.S.; Forlenza, O.V.; Busatto, G.F.; Zanetti, M.V.","The identification of biological markers at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) contributes to diagnostic accuracy and adds prognostic value. However, in spite of recent developments, results of neurostructural imaging studies on predicting conversion to AD are not uniform. We conducted a systematic review of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies about the neurostructural predictors of conversion to AD. Ten studies met inclusion criteria and nine reported baseline regional gray matter (GM) atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or healthy subjects who progressed to AD. Using the method of Activation Likelihood Estimation, we meta-analyzed the coordinates from the six longitudinal VBM studies that enrolled subjects with amnestic MCI (aMCI) at baseline. These comprised a total of 429 aMCI subjects, of which 142 converted to AD. Meta-analysis yielded one significant cluster of GM volumetric reduction in aMCI patients who converted to AD, located in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. In conclusion, left medial temporal lobe atrophy is the most consistent neurostructural biomarker to predict conversion from aMCI to AD.

Embase,"Latest advances on interventions that may prevent, delay or ameliorate dementia","Wilson, D.; Peters, R.; Ritchie, K.; Ritchie, C.W.","Objectives: In this paper we aim to: (1) identify and review midlife risk factors that may contribute to the development of dementia and that may be amenable to intervention; (2) review advances made in our understanding of the most common cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), where current pharmacological studies have aimed to modify the disease course; and (3) explore other interventions that may slow cognitive decline in those with AD. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted to look for interventions that may modify the risk of incident dementia or that may modify symptom progression in those with diagnosed dementia. Results: (1) Midlife risks identified as amenable to intervention include blood pressure, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, poor psychosocial and lifestyle factors. (2) The leading drugs in development can be grouped by their principal target: anti-amyloid, anti-tau and mitochondrial stability. However to date, there have been no successes in late stage Phase III trials of putative disease-modifying drugs for AD. (3) Once the diagnosis of dementia has been made there is little that can slow the rate of decline. Possible exceptions include the use of exercise and antihypertensive medication with some nootropic medication showing promise in small trials. Conclusion: (1) It is clear that there are several risk factors in midlife that may lead to a greater likelihood of developing dementia. However, there is no simple intervention to modify these risks. It seems sensible to conclude from the data that avoiding high blood pressure, controlling cholesterol and diabetes as well as maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle may lower the risk of developing dementia. (2) The need for better outcome measures in clinical trials is evident and may, in part, explain the numerous failures in late-stage clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs. Improved diagnostic test batteries to reduce population heterogeneity in early intervention studies will be required for robust clinical trials in the future. (3) Current research indicates that there is little that can delay decline; however, future trials may wish to focus on nootropics.

Embase,Advanced dental disease in people with severe mental illness: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Kisely, S.; Quek, L.-H.; Pais, J.; Lalloo, R.; Johnson, N.W.; Lawrence, D.","Background: Psychiatric patients have increased comorbid physical illness. There is less information concerning dental disease in this population in spite of risk factors including diet and psychotropic side-effects (such as xerostomia). Aims: To compare the oral health of people with severe mental illness with that of the general population. Method: A systematic search for studies from the past 20 years was conducted using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and article bibliographies. Papers were independently assessed. The primary outcome was total tooth loss (edentulousness), the end-stage of both untreated caries and periodontal disease. We also assessed dental decay through standardised measures: the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) or surfaces (DMFS). For studies lacking a control group we used controls of similar ages from a community survey within 10 years of the study. Results: We identified 21 papers of which 14 had sufficient data (n = 2784 psychiatric patients) and suitable controls (n = 31 084) for a random effects meta-analysis. People with severe mental illness had 3.4 times the odds of having lost all their teeth than the general community (95% CI 1.6-7.2). They also had significantly higher scores for DMFT (mean difference 6.2, 95% CI 0.6-11.8) and DMFS (mean difference 14.6, 95% CI 4.1-25.1). Fluoridated water reduced the gap in oral health between psychiatric patients and the general population. Conclusions: Psychiatric patients have not shared in the improving oral health of the general population. Management should include oral health assessment using standard checklists that can be completed by non-dental personnel.

Embase,Depression in Down Syndrome: A review of the literature,"Walker, J.C.; Dosen, A.; Buitelaar, J.K.; Janzing, J.G.E.","Background: Depression has been frequently reported in individuals with Down Syndrome (DS). The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive, critical review of the clinically relevant literature concerning depression in DS, with a focus on epidemiology, potential risk factors, diagnosis, course characteristics and treatment. Methods: We searched the PUBMED database (January 2011) using the keywords ("" Depressive Disorder [MESH]"" OR "" Depression [MESH]"" OR "" depress* [All Fields]"" ) AND ("" Down Syndrome [MESH]"" OR "" Down syndrome [All Fields]"" OR "" Down's syndrome [All Fields]"" ). Review articles not adding new information, single case reports and papers focusing on subjects other than depression in DS were excluded. Results: The PUBMED search resulted in 390 articles, of which 30 articles were finally included. Recent information does not support earlier suggestions of an increased prevalence of depression in DS compared to other causes of Intellectual Disability (ID). However, individuals with DS show many vulnerabilities and are exposed to high levels of stressors that could confer an increased risk for the development of depression. Apart from general risk factors, several potential risk factors are more specific for DS, including smaller hippocampal volumes, certain changes in neurotransmitter systems, deficits in language and working memory, attachment behaviours and frequently occurring somatic disorders. Protective factors might play a role in reducing the vulnerability to depression. The diagnosis of depression in DS is mainly based upon observable characteristics, and therefore, the use of modified diagnostic criteria is advised.Although several common treatments, including antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy seem effective, there is evidence of undertreatment of depression in DS. Conclusions: There are important limitations to our current clinical knowledge of depression in DS. Future studies should include systematic evaluations of pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic interventions.

Embase,Etiologies of epilepsy: A comprehensive review,"Bhalla, D.; Godet, B.; Druet-Cabanac, M.; Preux, P.-M.","Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder, the symptoms of which are preventable and controllable to some extent. Significant inter- and intra-country differences in incidence and prevalence exist because multiple etiologic factors are implicated. Many past reviews have addressed sole etiologies. We considered a comprehensive view of all etiologies (genetic/structural/metabolic) to be significant for both the developing and the developed world as well as routine clinical/epidemiology practice. We therefore carried out a comprehensive search for peer-reviewed articles (irrespective of year, region and language; chosen based on novelty and importance) for each etiology. This article was felt to be essential since newer etiologic knowledge has emerged in recent years. Many new genetic links for rarer epilepsy forms have emerged. Epilepsy risk in limbic encephalitis, mechanisms of Alzheimer's-related epilepsy and the genetic basis of cortical malformations have been detailed. An etiological approach to epilepsy in combination with the conventional classification of epilepsy syndromes is required to gain knowledge.

Embase,Screening tools for the identification of elder abuse,"Cohen, M.","â€¢ Objective: To review existing tools for screening for elder abuse. â€¢ Methods: Search of international databases and a review of validated tools for identifying abuse and screening for abuse. â€¢ Results: Elder abuse prevalence rates are underestimated in the literature, and many abuse victims fail to receive the professional help that could improve their quality of life. A number of structured and validated tools can be used to identify abuse victims. Three types of tools are discussed: direct questioning, inspecting for signs of abuse, and evaluating for risk factors for abuse. An integrative model that encompasses the 3 screening modes is described. Considerations regarding special populations and cultural aspects should be incorporated into the screening process. â€¢ Conclusion: Brief screening tools have many advantages, but they also have weaknesses. Further research is needed to assess their validity, applicability, and accuracy for use in different settings and by different professionals.

We collected data from published meta-analyses (MAs) of clinical trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The Medline, Cochrane, ISI, and SCOPUS databases were systematically searched for MAs of NSAID clinical trials that could potentially contain data on adverse incidents such as myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular events (CeVs), stroke, thromboembolic events (ThEs), heart failure (HF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and perforation, ulcer, and bleeding (PUB). From 1,733 identified references, 29 MAs were selected for the review. This allowed 109 estimations of incidence rates of CV adverse events and 26 estimations of incidence rates for GI adverse events. No data were found on hemorrhagic stroke or LGIB. Coxibs were studied in more MAs than traditional NSAIDs were (21 MAs for coxibs vs. 7 for traditional NSAIDs; one meta-analysis studied both). Many NSAIDs were not considered in any of the MAs.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature, including all prospective, longitudinal or cross-sectional studies assessing both peripheral artery disease (PAD), defined by a low ABI, and cognitive function. Results: 12 publications were included in this review, of whom 6 reported cross-sectional analysis and 6 reported longitudinal analysis. All except one reported a significant association between a low ankle-brachial index and cognitive impairment, dementia or AD. Beyond cognitive impairment, patients with PAD are at an increased risk to develop dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: In this review, we confirm that a low (<0.90) ABI can be considered as a marker of cognitive impairment and dementia. ABI provides independent and supplemental information on subject's susceptibility to develop cognitive disorders, along its usefulness to predict cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Given its availability, easiness, safety to patients and low cost, the ABI could be useful in clinical practice and research in the field of cognitive diseases.

Embase,Cognitive function and risk for depression in old age: A meta-analysis of published literature,"Huang, C.-Q.; Wang, Z.-R.; Li, Y.-H.; Xie, Y.-Z.; Liu, Q.-X.","Background: We assessed the relationship between cognitive impairment (including mild cognitive impairment with no signs of dementia, and dementia) and risk for depression in old age (60 years and older). Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library database were used to identify potential studies. All of the clinical studies that produced data on the association between cognitive function and risk of depression among individuals aged 55 years or older were identified and included in this review. The studies were classified into cross-sectional and longitudinal subsets. The quantitative meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were performed. For prevalence and incidence rates of depression, odds risk (OR) and relative risk (RR) were calculated, respectively. Results: Since all but two studies found in the search were for individuals aged 60 years or over, we assessed and reported on results for this larger group only. In this review we included 13 cross-sectional and four prospective longitudinal studies. The quantitative meta-analysis showed that, in old age, individuals with non-dementia cognitive impairment had neither significant higher prevalence nor incidence rates of depression than those without (odds risk (OR): 1.48, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 0.87-2.52; relative risk (RR): 1.12, 95% CI: 0.62-2.01). In old age, individuals with dementia had both significant higher prevalence and incidence rates of depression than those without (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.15-2.89; RR: 3.92, 95% CI: 1.93-7.99). Conclusions: Despite the methodological limitations of this meta-analysis, we found that in old age, there was no association between depression and cognitive impairment with no dementia; however, there was a definite association between depression and dementia and thus dementia might be a risk for depression.

Embase,What is resilience? A review and concept analysis,"Windle, G.","The complexities of defining what appears to be the relatively simple concept of resilience are widely recognized. This paper analyses the concept of resilience from a range of disciplinary perspectives and clarifies a definition in order to inform research, policy and practice. The work takes a life course approach to resilience, examining evidence derived from research across the lifespan. It incorporates the methods of systematic review, concept analysis and consultation through face-to-face meetings. The synthesis of methodological approaches enables a clear identification of the antecedents, defining attributes and consequences of resilience, validated with stakeholder partners. Through this process, resilience is defined as the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing significant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and 'bouncing back' in the face of adversity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary. A large proportion of resilience research is routed within the discipline of developmental psychology, and has mainly been developed with children and adolescents. A major contribution to resilience research could be made through more multi-disciplinary studies that examine the dynamics of resilience across the lifespan, its role in healthy ageing and in managing loss, such as changes in cognitive functioning.

Embase,Alzheimers disease: A review of recent developments,"Salawu, F.K.; Umar, J.T.; Olokoba, A.B.","Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in aging adults, and a substantial burden to patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. It is an increasingly significant public health issue; with the number of people living with AD projected to increase dramatically over the next few decades, making the search for treatments and tools to measure disease progression increasingly urgent. This review is based on a search of Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, and citation lists of relevant publications. The subject headings and keywords used were Alzheimers disease, dementia, primary neuronal degeneration and senile plagues. Only the articles written in English were included. The diagnosis is still primarily made based on history and physical and neurologic examinations. Approved treatments are few and of limited efficacy, serving mostly to slow or delay progression and not to cure the disease, despite significant research by pharmaceutical industries. Cholinesterase inhibitors offer some help in treating cognitive and global functioning, as well as behavioral abnormalities in patients with mild-, moderate-, or severe-stage disease. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, memantine, is similarly effective alone or in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors in moderate to severe stages of the disease.

Embase,Physical exercise as a preventive or disease-modifying treatment of dementia and brain aging,"Ahlskog, J.E.; Geda, Y.E.; Graff-Radford, N.R.; Petersen, R.C.","A rapidly growing literature strongly suggests that exercise, specifically aerobic exercise, may attenuate cognitive impairment and reduce dementia risk. We used PubMed (keywords exercise and cognition) and manuscript bibliographies to examine the published evidence of a cognitive neuroprotective effect of exercise. Meta-analyses of prospective studies documented a significantly reduced risk of dementia associated with midlife exercise; similarly, midlife exercise significantly reduced later risks of mild cognitive impairment in several studies. Among patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) documented better cognitive scores after 6 to 12 months of exercise compared with sedentary controls. Meta-analyses of RCTs of aerobic exercise in healthy adults were also associated with significantly improved cognitive scores. One year of aerobic exercise in a large RCT of seniors was associated with significantly larger hippocampal volumes and better spatial memory; other RCTs in seniors documented attenuation of age-related gray matter volume loss with aerobic exercise. Cross-sectional studies similarly reported significantly larger hippocampal or gray matter volumes among physically fit seniors compared with unfit seniors. Brain cognitive networks studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging display improved connectivity after 6 to 12 months of exercise. Animal studies indicate that exercise facilitates neuroplasticity via a variety of biomechanisms, with improved learning outcomes. Induction of brain neurotrophic factors by exercise has been confirmed in multiple animal studies, with indirect evidence for this process in humans. Besides a brain neuroprotective effect, physical exercise may also attenuate cognitive decline via mitigation of cerebrovascular risk, including the contribution of small vessel disease to dementia. Exercise should not be overlooked as an important therapeutic strategy.

Embase,Preventing late-life depression: A clinical update,"Baldwin, R.C.","Background: Achieving remission in late-life depressive disorder is difficult; it is far better to prevent depression. In the last ten years there have been a number of clinical studies of the feasibility of prevention. Methods: A limited literature review was undertaken of studies from 2000 specifically concerning the primary prevention of late-life depressive disorder or where primary prevention is a relevant secondary outcome. Results: Selective primary prevention (targeting individuals at risk but not expressing depression) has been shown to be effective for stroke and macular degeneration but not hip fracture. It may also prove effective for the depression associated with caregiving in dementia. Emerging evidence finds effectiveness for indicated prevention (in those identified with subthreshold depression often with other risk factors such as functional limitation). Despite a number of promising risk factors (for example, diet, exercise, vascular risk factors, homocysteine and insomnia), universal prevention of late-life depression (acting to reduce the impact of risk factors at the population level) has no current evidence base, although a population approach might mitigate suicide. Conclusion: Interventions which work in preventing late-life depression include antidepressant medication in standard doses and Problem-Solving Treatment. When integrated into a care model, such as collaborative care, prevention is feasible but more economic studies are needed.

However, this development has not been accompanied by a critical discussion of the early and late health complications. Methods: We selectively review recent studies on the acute, subacute, and chronic neuropsychiatric consequences of boxing. Results: Cerebral concussions (""knock-outs"") are the most relevant acute consequence of boxing. The number of reported cases of death in the ring seems to have mildly decreased. Subacute neuropsychological deficits appear to last longer than subjective symptoms. The associated molecular changes demonstrate neuronal and glial injury correlated with the number and severity of blows to the head (altered total tau, beta-amyloid, neurofilament light protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neuron-specific enolase). The risk of a punch-drunk syndrome (boxer's dementia, dementia pugilistica) as a late effect of chronic traumatic brain injury is associated with the duration of a boxer's career and with his earlier stamina. There are similarities (e.g. increased risk with ApoE4-polymorphism, beta-amyloid pathology) and differences (more tau pathology in boxers) compared with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: Protective gear has led to a remarkable reduction of risks in amateur boxing.

RESULTS: Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors and several primary prevention strategies have been described, several of them with positive outcomes mainly for depressive disorders and suicide. In conditions such as bipolar disorder, dementias, and geriatric schizophrenia, there is either a paucity of studies or no robust primary prevention strategies identified.

Methods: Existing reviews and major electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The deadline for study inclusion was September 15, 2008. Intervention categories and outcome domains were predefined by consensus. Two researchers working together detected 1,313 candidate studies of which 179 RCTs belonging to 26 intervention categories were selected. Cognitive deterioration had to be documented in all participants, and degenerative etiology (indicating dementia) had to be present or presumed in at least 80% of the subjects. Evidence tables, meta-analysis and summaries of results were elaborated by the first author and reviewed by author subgroups. Methods for rating level of evidence and grading practice recommendations were adapted from the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. Results: Grade A treatment recommendation was achieved for institutionalization delay (multicomponent interventions for the caregiver, CG). Grade B recommendation was reached for the person with dementia (PWD) for: improvement in cognition (cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, multicomponent interventions for the PWD); activities of daily living (ADL) (ADL training, multicomponent interventions for the PWD); behavior (cognitive stimulation, multicomponent interventions for the PWD, behavioral interventions, professional CG training); mood (multicomponent interventions for the PWD); QoL (multicomponent interventions for PWD and CG) and restraint prevention (professional CG training); for the CG, grade B was also reached for: CG mood (CG education, CG support, multicomponent interventions for the CG); CG psychological well-being (cognitive stimulation, multicomponent interventions for the CG); CG QoL (multicomponent interventions for PWD and CG). Conclusion: NPTs emerge as a useful, versatile and potentially cost-effective approach to improve outcomes and QoL in ADRD for both the PWD and CG. Copyright Â© 2010 S.

Cochrane, Donepezil for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease," Birks, JS;  Harvey, RJ"," Abstract - Background Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people. One approach to symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by blocking the action of the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This can be done by a group of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 1998. Objectives To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of donepezil in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease; to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of donepezil; and to assess the effect of donepezil on healthcare resource use and costs. Search methods We searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvementâ€™s Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and a number of other sources on 20 May 2017 to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and upâ€êtoâ€êdate as possible. In addition, we contacted members of the Donepezil Study Group and Eisai Inc. Selection criteria We included all doubleâ€êblind, randomised controlled trials in which treatment with donepezil was administered to people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease for 12 weeks or more and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients, or where two different doses of donepezil were compared. Data collection and analysis One reviewer (JSB) extracted data on cognitive function, activities of daily living, behavioural symptoms, global clinical state, quality of life, adverse events, deaths and healthcare resource costs. Where appropriate and possible, we estimated pooled treatment effects. We used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results Thirty studies involving 8257 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, of which 28 studies reported results in sufficient detail for the metaâ€êanalyses. Most studies were of six months' duration or less. Only one small trial lasted 52 weeks. The studies tested mainly donepezil capsules at a dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day. Two studies tested a slowâ€êrelease oral formulation that delivered 23 mg/day. Participants in 21 studies had mild to moderate disease, in five studies moderate to severe, and in four severe disease. Seventeen studies were industry funded or sponsored, four studies were funded independently of industry and for nine studies there was no information on source of funding. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of donepezil 10 mg/day with placebo at 24 to 26 weeks of treatment. Thirteen studies contributed data from 3396 participants to this analysis. Eleven of these studies were multicentre studies. Seven studies recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, two with moderate to severe, and four with severe Alzheimer's disease, with a mean age of about 75 years. Almost all evidence was of moderate quality, downgraded due to study limitations. After 26 weeks of treatment, donepezil compared with placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scaleâ€êCognitive (ADASâ€êCog, range 0 to 70) (mean difference (MD) â€ê2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) â€ê3.31 to â€ê2.02, 1130 participants, 5 studies), the Miniâ€êMental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37, 1757 participants, 7 studies) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB, range 0 to 100) (MD 5.92, 95% CI 4.53 to 7.31, 1348 participants, 5 studies). Donepezil was also associated with better function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living score for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCSâ€êADLâ€êsev) (MD 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.85, 733 participants, 3 studies). A higher proportion of participants treated with donepezil experienced improvement on the clinicianâ€êrated global impression of change scale (odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.39, 1674 participants, 6 studies). There was no difference between donepezil and placebo for behavioural symptoms measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD â€ê1.62, 95% CI â€ê3.43 to 0.19, 1035 participants, 4 studies) or by the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVEâ€êAD) scale (MD 0.4, 95% CI â€ê1.28 to 2.08, 194 participants, 1 study). There was also no difference between donepezil and placebo for Quality of Life (QoL) (MD â€ê2.79, 95% CI â€ê8.15 to 2.56, 815 participants, 2 studies). Participants receiving donepezil were more likely to withdraw from the studies before the end of treatment (24% versus 20%, OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50, 2846 participants, 12 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the studies (72% vs 65%, OR 1.59, 95% 1.31 to 1.95, 2500 participants, 10 studies). There was no evidence of a difference between donepezil and placebo for patient total healthcare resource utilisation. Three studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 5 mg/day over 26 weeks. The 5 mg dose was associated with slightly worse cognitive function on the ADASâ€êCog, but not on the MMSE or SIB, with slightly better QoL and with fewer adverse events and withdrawals from treatment. Two studies compared donepezil 10 mg/day to donepezil 23 mg/day. There were no differences on efficacy outcomes, but fewer participants on 10 mg/day experienced adverse events or withdrew from treatment. Authors' conclusions There is moderateâ€êquality evidence that people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease treated for periods of 12 or 24 weeks with donepezil experience small benefits in cognitive function, activities of daily living and clinicianâ€êrated global clinical state. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive compared with placebo when assessing total healthcare resource costs. Benefits on 23 mg/day were no greater than on 10 mg/day, and benefits on the 10 mg/day dose were marginally larger than on the 5 mg/day dose, but the rates of withdrawal and of adverse events before end of treatment were higher the higher the dose. Plain language summary Donepezil for people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease Review question What effects (benefits or harms) does donepezil have on people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease? Background Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. As the disease progresses, people lose the ability to remember, communicate, think clearly and perform the activities of daily living. Their behaviour may also change. In severe Alzheimer's disease people lose the ability to care for themselves. The most commonly used treatment for Alzheimer's disease are medicines known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil is one of these medicines. It is taken as a pill once a day. In Alzheimer's disease, one of the changes in the brain is a reduced number of nerve cells called cholinergic neurones. These are nerve cells that signal to other cells using a chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, work by preventing acetylcholine from being broken down. This may improve the symptoms of dementia. However, acetylcholine is also found elsewhere in the body and so drugs of this type may have unwanted effects. Review methods In this review we examined evidence about benefits and harms from studies that compared donepezil, taken for at least 12 weeks, to placebo (a dummy pill), or that compared different doses of donepezil. The studies had to be doubleâ€êblind and randomised, that is, the decision whether people taking part got donepezil or placebo had to be made randomly and neither they nor the researchers should have known which treatment they were getting while the trial was going on. This was to make the comparison as unbiased, or fair, as possible. We searched for studies up to May 2017. We assessed the quality of all the studies we included. When it was sensible to do so, we analysed the results of studies together to get an overall result. Key results We included 30 studies with 8257 participants. Most of the people in the studies had mild or moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, but in nine studies they had moderate or severe dementia. Almost all of the studies lasted six months or less. The majority of the studies were known to have been funded by the manufacturer of donepezil. We found that people with Alzheimer's disease who took 10 mg of donepezil a day for six months did slightly better than people taking placebo, on scales measuring their cognitive function (e.g. thinking and remembering), how well they could manage their daily activities, and the overall impression of a trained researcher. We did not find any effect on behaviour or quality of life. People taking donepezil were more likely than those taking placebo to report side effects and to drop out of the studies. Most side effects were described as mild. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were most common. Comparing 5 mg of donepezil a day with 10 mg/day, people on 5 mg had fewer side effects, but did slightly less well on cognitive function tests. A higher dose (23 mg/day) offered no advantages and was associated with more side effects. There is some evidence that use of donepezil is neither more nor less expensive than placebo when total health care costs are taken into account. Quality of the evidence In general, we thought that the quality of the evidence was moderate. The main factor reducing our confidence was concern that the results of some studies might have been biased by the way they were done. We cannot be sure that the results apply to treatment longer than six months. Conclusions After six months of treatment, there are benefits of donepezil that are large enough to measure in studies. It is associated with side effects that are mainly mild, but that may cause people to stop treatment. Being able to stabilise cognitive performance or ability to maintain activities of daily living may be important clinically. In terms of total healthcare costs the use of donepezil appears cost neutral. However, there does not appear to be an effect on quality of life. More data are still required from longerâ€êterm clinical studies examining measures of disease progression or time to needing full time care.",2018,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,6,, CD001190, 10.1002/14651858.CD001190.pub3,,#40,Birks 2018
Cochrane, Rivastigmine for vascular cognitive impairment," Birks, J;  McGuinness, B;  Craig, D"," Abstract - Background Vascular dementia represents the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. In older patients, in particular, the combination of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease is common, and is referred to as mixed dementia. The classification of vascular dementia broadly follows three clinicoâ€êpathological processes: multiâ€êinfarct dementia, single strategic infarct dementia and subcortical dementia. Not all victims fulfil strict criteria for dementia and may be significantly cognitively impaired without memory loss, when the term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is more useful. Currently, no established standard treatment for VCI exists. Reductions in acetylcholine and acetyltransferase activity are common to both Alzheimer's disease and VCI, raising the possibility that cholinesterase inhibitors â€ê such as rivastigmine â€ê which are beneficial in Alzheimer's disease, may also be beneficial for VCI. Objectives To assess the efficacy of rivastigmine compared with placebo in the treatment of people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groupâ€™s Specialized Register) on 12 February 2013 using the terms: rivastigmine, exelon, ""SDZ ENA 713"". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All unconfounded randomized doubleâ€êblind trials comparing rivastigmine with placebo in the treatment of people with VCI, vascular dementia or mixed dementia were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted and assessed data independently, and agreement was reached after discussion. They noted results concerning adverse effects. Main results Three trials, with a total of 800 participants, were identified for inclusion. The participants in one trial did not have dementia, while the other two studies included participants with dementia of different severities. The dose of rivastigmine was different in each study. No pooling of study results was attempted because of these differences between the studies. One trial included 40 participants with subcortical vascular dementia (age range 40 to 90 years) with a mean miniâ€êmental state examination (MMSE) score of 13.0 and 13.4 in the rivastigmine and placebo arms, respectively. Treatment over 26 weeks was limited to 3 mg rivastigmine twice daily, or placebo. No significant difference was found on any outcome measure relevant to cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, function or global rating, or in the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment. Another trial included 710 participants with vascular dementia, including subcortical and cortical forms (age range 50 to 85 years). Over 24 weeks, a mean dose of rivastigmine of 9.4 mg/day was achieved versus placebo. Baseline MMSE was identical for both groups, at 19.1. Statistically significant advantage in cognitive response (but not with global impression of change or nonâ€êcognitive measures) was seen with rivastigmine treatment at 24 weeks (MMSE change from baseline MD 0.6, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.09, P value 0.02; Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale (VaDAS) change from baseline MD â€ê1.3, 95% CIâ€ê2.62 to 0.02, P value 0.05 ). Significantly higher rates of vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea and anorexia and withdrawals from treatment were noted in the participants randomized to rivastigmine compared with placebo (withdrawals rivastigmine 90/365, placebo 48/345, OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.98) (withdrawals due to an adverse event rivastigmine 49/365, placebo 19/345, OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.62, P value 0.0005). The third study included 50 participants (age range 48 to 84 years) with mean MMSE scores of 23.7 and 23.9 in the rivastigmine and placebo arms, respectively. Over a 24â€êweek period, participants labelled as having cognitive impairment but no dementia (CIND) following ischaemic stroke were given up to 4.5 mg rivastigmine twice daily, or placebo. Primary and secondary outcome measures showed no statistically significant difference when considering neurocognitive abilities, function, neuropsychiatric symptoms and global performance. One participant in the rivastigmine group and two in the placebo group discontinued their medication because of an adverse effect. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence of benefit of rivastigmine in VCI from trial data from three studies. However, this conclusion is based on one large study. Rivastigmine is capable of inducing side effects that lead to withdrawal in a significant proportion of patients. Plain language summary Rivastigmine for vascular cognitive impairment Vascular dementia (i.e. dementia caused by disease of blood vessels affecting the supply of blood to the brain) is one of the most common types of dementia. It includes dementia caused by stroke. It may exist by itself or with other common dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Sometimes vascular disease can present with cognitive problems which are less severe than dementia. Those with vascular dementia may have significant cognitive impairment without major memory loss. The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is useful, because of the range of different ways in which people are affected. Rivastigmine is a drug widely used in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It works by preventing breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter (signalling molecule). Levels of acetylcholine are reduced in VCI as well as in AD and so it may also help people with VCI. Researchers searched for all trials that compared rivastigmine with placebo in people with VCI, and identified three. Only one of these showed any significant results, and it did show some benefit for people with VCI who took rivastigmine. However, nausea and vomiting were a frequent side effect of taking the drug. Therefore it remains uncertain how useful rivastigmine is for people with VCI .",2013,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,5,, CD004744, 10.1002/14651858.CD004744.pub3,,#37,Birks 2013
Cochrane, Metal protein attenuating compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia," Sampson, EL;  Jenagaratnam, L;  McShane, R"," Abstract - Background Alzheimer's dementia (AD) may be caused by the formation of extracellular senile plaques comprised of betaâ€êamyloid (AÃŸ). In vitro and mouse model studies have demonstrated that metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACs) promote the solubilisation and clearance of AÃŸ. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACs) for the treatment of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's dementia. Search methods We searched  ALOIS , the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 29 July 2010 using the terms: Clioquinol OR PBT1 OR PBT2 OR ""metal protein"" OR MPACS OR MPAC. Selection criteria Randomised doubleâ€êblind trials in which treatment with an MPAC was administered to participants with Alzheimer's dementia in a parallel group comparison with placebo were included. Data collection and analysis Three review authors (RM, LJ, ELS) independently assessed the quality of trials according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . The primary outcome measure of interest was cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests). The secondary outcome measures of interest were in the following areas: quality of life, functional performance, effect on carer, biomarkers, safety and adverse effects, and death. Main results Two MPAC trials were identified. One trial compared clioquinol (PBT1) with placebo in 36 patients and 32 had sufficient data for per protocol analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in cognition (as measured on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale â€ê Cognition (ADASâ€êCog)) between the active treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks. The difference in mean change from baseline ADASâ€êCog score in the clioquinol arm compared with the placebo arm at weeks 24 and 36 was a difference of 7.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 13.24) and 6.36 (95% CI â€ê0.50 to 13.23), respectively.There was no significant impact on nonâ€êcognitive symptoms or clinical global impression. One participant in the active treatment group developed neurological symptoms (impaired visual acuity and colour vision) which resolved on cessation of treatment and were possibly attributable to the drug. In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intentionâ€êtoâ€êtreat analysis. There was no significant difference in the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) composite or memory between placebo and PBT2 in the least squares mean change from baseline at week 12. However, two executive function component tests of the NTB showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group from baseline to week 12: category fluency test (2.8 words, 95% CI 0.1 to 5.4; P = 0.041) and trail making part B (â€ê48.0 s, 95% CI â€ê83.0 to â€ê13.0; P = 0.009). In the executive factor  Z  score, the difference in least squares mean change from baseline at week 12 for PBT2 250 mg compared with placebo was 0Â·27 (0Â·01 to 0Â·53; p=0Â·042).There was no significant effect on cognition on Miniâ€êMental State Examination (MMSE) or ADASâ€êCog scales. PBT2 had a favourable safety profile. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of evidence as to whether clioquinol (PBT1) has any positive clinical benefit for patients with AD, or whether the drug is safe. We have some concerns about the quality of the study methodology; there was an imbalance in treatment and control groups after randomisation (participants in the active treatment group had a higher mean preâ€êmorbid IQ) and the secondary analyses of results stratified by baseline dementia severity. The planned phase III trial of PBT1 has been abandoned and this compound has been withdrawn from development. The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. Larger trials are now required to demonstrate cognitive efficacy. Plain language summary There is no evidence that MPACs (PBT1 or PBT2) are of benefit in Alzheimer's dementia The protein amyloidâ€êÎ_ (AÃŸ) is strongly implicated in the development of Alzheimer's dementia, where it aggregates in clumps causing damage and death of brain cells. This clumping is encouraged by copper and zinc (metal ions) in the brain. Metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACS) bind strongly to copper and zinc (this is known as chelation), both preventing the clumping together of AÃŸ and promoting processes which may cause it to dissolve and so be cleared from brain cells. Therefore MPACS may be a potential therapy for Alzheimer's dementia. Two different types of MPAC have been used in clinical trials and the drugs are known as PBT1 and PBT2. The trial of PBT1 compared with placebo (in 36 patients) showed no statistically significant difference in cognition or memory between the active treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks. We therefore conclude that there is no current evidence that treatment with clioquinol (PBT1) has any significant effect on cognition and in particular memory (as measured by the ADASâ€êCog scale) in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. This drug has now been withdrawn from development. The trial of PBT2 showed it was safe after 12 weeks of treatment but demonstrated no overall significant effect on cognition or memory.",2014,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,2,, CD005380, 10.1002/14651858.CD005380.pub5,,#33,Sampson 2014
Cochrane, Deâ€êescalation techniques for managing nonâ€êpsychosis induced aggression in adults," Spencer, S;  Johnson, P;  Smith, IC"," Abstract - Background Aggression occurs frequently within health and social care settings. It can result in injury to patients and staff and can adversely affect staff performance and wellâ€êbeing. Deâ€êescalation is a widely used and recommended intervention for managing aggression, but the efficacy of the intervention as a whole and the specific techniques that comprise it are unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of deâ€êescalation techniques for managing nonâ€êpsychosisâ€êinduced aggression in adults in care settings, in both staff and service users. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and 14 other databases in September 2017, plus three trials registers in October 2017. We also checked references, and contacted study authors and authorities in the field to identify additional published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiâ€êRCTs comparing deâ€êescalation techniques with standard practice or alternative techniques for managing aggressive behaviour in adult care settings. We excluded studies in which participants had psychosis. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results This review includes just one clusterâ€êrandomised study of 306 older people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, conducted across 16 nursing homes in France. The study did not measure any of our primary or secondary outcomes but did measure behavioural change using three measurement scales: the Cohenâ€êMansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI; 29â€êitem scale), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; 12â€êitem scale), and the Observation Scale (OS; 25â€êitem scale). For the CMAI, the study reports a Global score (29 items rated on a sevenâ€êpoint scale (1 = never occurs to 7 = occurs several times an hour) and summed to give a total score ranging from 29 to 203) and mean scores (evaluable items (rated on the same 7â€êpoint scale) divided by the theoretical total number of items) for the following four domains: Physically Nonâ€êAggressive Behaviour, such as pacing (13 items); Verbally Nonâ€êAggressive Behaviour, such as repetition (four items); Physically Aggressive Behaviour, such as hitting (nine items); and Verbally Aggressive Behaviour, such as swearing (three items). Four of the five CMAI scales improved in the intervention group (Global: change mean difference (MD) âˆ’5.69 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) âˆ’9.59 to âˆ’1.79; Physically Nonâ€êAggressive: change MD âˆ’0.32 points, 95% CI âˆ’0.49 to âˆ’0.15; Verbally Nonâ€êAggressive: change MD âˆ’0.44 points, 95% CI âˆ’0.69 to âˆ’0.19; and Verbally Aggressive: change MD âˆ’0.16 points, 95% CI âˆ’0.31 to âˆ’0.01). There was no difference in change scores on the Physically Aggressive scale (MD âˆ’0.08 points, 95% CI âˆ’0.37 to 0.21). Using GRADE guidelines, we rated the quality of this evidence as very low due to high risk of bias and indirectness of the outcome measures. There were no differences in NPI or OS change scores between groups by the end of the study. We also identified one ongoing study. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence means that uncertainty remains around the effectiveness of deâ€êescalation and the relative efficacy of different techniques. Highâ€êquality research on the effectiveness of this intervention is therefore urgently needed. Plain language summary Using deâ€êescalation to prevent violence in aggressive people Review questions Do deâ€êescalation techniques help to calm down adults who are being aggressive in care settings? Which techniques work best? Background There are many reasons why people may be aggressive in care settings, including mental or physical illness. People can use a range of techniques to help someone who is behaving aggressively to calm down, including talking to the person and interpreting nonâ€êverbal gestures and body language. This approach is referred to as deâ€êescalation. Although it is widely taught and used, we know very little about how effective deâ€êescalation is, or which techniques work best. Study characteristics We looked for all available evidence on this topic, finding just two studies. One of these included 306 people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, living in 16 nursing homes in France. The second study is still in progress and did not provide results for the review. Key results The study did not assess areas important to us, such as the number of injuries sustained by staff or residents. It did, however, measure the impact of staff training on residents' level of aggression three months after the end of the training. Some measures of physical and verbal aggression showed reductions, but not all. Quality of the evidence The reliability of evidence available in the one included trial is very low and did not address important questions such as injury. Therefore, we cannot say whether deâ€êescalation techniques are effective.

Cochrane, ADâ€ê8 for detection of dementia across a variety of healthcare settings," Hendry, K;  Green, C;  McShane, R;  Noelâ€êStorr, AH;  Stott, DJ;  Anwer, S;  Sutton, AJ;  Burton, JK;  Quinn, TJ"," Abstract - Background Dementia assessment often involves initial screening, using a brief tool, followed by more detailed assessment where required. The ADâ€ê8 is a short questionnaire, completed by a suitable 'informant' who knows the person well. ADâ€ê8 is designed to assess change in functional performance secondary to cognitive change. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the informantâ€êbased ADâ€ê8 questionnaire, in detection of allâ€êcause (undifferentiated) dementia in adults. Where data were available, we described the following: the diagnostic accuracy of the ADâ€ê8 at various predefined threshold scores; the diagnostic accuracy of the ADâ€ê8 for each healthcare setting and the effects of heterogeneity on the reported diagnostic accuracy of the ADâ€ê8. Search methods We searched the following sources on 27 May 2014, with an update to 7 June 2018: ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection (includes Conference Proceedings Citation Index) (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME). We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on the ADâ€ê8 to try to find additional studies. We developed a sensitive search strategy and used standardised database subject headings as appropriate. Foreign language publications were translated. Selection criteria We selected those studies which included the ADâ€ê8 to assess for the presence of dementia and where dementia diagnosis was confirmed with clinical assessment. We only included those studies where the ADâ€ê8 was used as an informant assessment. We made no exclusions in relation to healthcare setting, language of ADâ€ê8 or the ADâ€ê8 score used to define a 'test positive' case. Data collection and analysis We screened all titles generated by electronic database searches, and reviewed abstracts of potentially relevant studies. Two independent assessors checked full papers for eligibility and extracted data. We extracted data into twoâ€êbyâ€êtwo tables to allow calculation of accuracy metrics for individual studies. We then created summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios using the bivariate approach and plotting results in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. We determined quality assessment (risk of bias and applicability) using the QUADASâ€ê2 tool. Main results From 36 papers describing ADâ€ê8 test accuracy, we included 10 papers. We utilised data from nine papers with 4045 individuals, 1107 of whom (27%) had a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Pooled analysis of seven studies, using an ADâ€ê8 informant cutâ€êoff score of two, indicated that sensitivity was 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 0.96); specificity was 0.64 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.82); the positive likelihood ratio was 2.53 (95% CI 1.38 to 4.64); and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.12 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.21). Pooled analysis of five studies, using an ADâ€ê8 informant cutâ€êoff score of three, indicated that sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.96); specificity was 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.89); the positive likelihood ratio was 3.86 (95% CI 2.03 to 7.34); and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.12 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.24). Four studies were conducted in community settings; four were in secondary care (one in the acute hospital); and one study was in primary care. The ADâ€ê8 has a higher relative sensitivity (1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.21), but lower relative specificity (0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.09) in secondary care compared to community care settings. There was heterogeneity across the included studies. Dementia prevalence rate varied from 12% to 90% of included participants. The tool was also used in various different languages. Among all the included studies there was evidence of risk of bias. Issues included the selection of participants, conduct of index test, and flow of assessment procedures. Authors' conclusions The high sensitivity of the ADâ€ê8 suggests it can be used to identify adults who may benefit from further specialist assessment and diagnosis, but is not a diagnostic test in itself. This pattern of high sensitivity and lower specificity is often suited to a screening test. Test accuracy varies by setting, however data in primary care and acute hospital settings are limited. This review identified significant heterogeneity and risk of bias, which may affect the validity of its summary findings. Plain language summary How accurate is the ADâ€ê8 informant questionnaire for diagnosing dementia in all healthcare settings? Why is recognising dementia important? Many people are living with dementia but have never had the condition diagnosed. Not recognising dementia when it is present (a false negative result) may deny people access to social support, medications, and financial assistance. It also prevents the individual and their family from planning for the future. However, incorrectly diagnosing dementia when it is not present (a false positive result) can cause distress or fear and lead to additional investigations which can waste resources. What is the aim of the review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate the ADâ€ê8 informant questionnaire is for detecting dementia in all healthcare settings. The researchers included 10 studies to answer this question, nine of which reported numerical information that could be used. What was studied in the review? The ADâ€ê8 questionnaire includes eight â€˜yes or noâ€™ questions, to be answered by someone who knows the person under investigation; for example, a relative, carer or close friend (sometimes described as an informant). The questions ask about whether the informant has noticed a change in the individualâ€™s memory and thinking abilities over the past years. A point is given for every item where they think the personâ€™s abilities have changed. Higher scores occur when more changes are noted by the informant. The ADâ€ê8 would not usually be used to make a final diagnosis of dementia, but it may help identify those who require further assessment. What are the main results of the review? The review included data from nine relevant studies, with a total of 4045 participants. Seven of the studies used a score of two or more to indicate dementia. A score of two or more is the cutâ€êoff recommended for the ADâ€ê8. The results of these studies indicate that, in theory, if the ADâ€ê8 were to be used to diagnose dementia in a group of 1000 people across all healthcare settings, of whom 280 (28%) have dementia, an estimated 517 would have an ADâ€ê8 result indicating dementia is present and of these 259 (50%) will not have dementia. Of the 483 people with a result indicating that dementia is not present, 22 (5%) would be incorrectly classified as not having dementia It is possible that the ADâ€ê8 may work differently in different settings, for example in hospital or General practice. In secondary care, the ADâ€ê8 produces more false positive results, but fewer false negative results, than when it is used in community settings. We could not directly compare the performance of the ADâ€ê8 in primary care as there was only one study from this setting. How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? In the included studies, the diagnosis of dementia was made by assessing all patients with a detailed clinical assessment. (In these studies, detailed clinical assessment was the gold standard we compared the ADâ€ê8 to.) This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had dementia. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may have resulted in the ADâ€ê8 appearing more accurate than it really is. The numbers described are an average across studies in the review. However, as estimates from individual studies varied we cannot be sure that the ADâ€ê8 will always produce these results. Who do the results of this review apply to? Studies included in the review were conducted in Brazil, China, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, the UK and USA. Studies included those attending primary and secondary care services, and populations of older adults living in the community. Five studies used the Englishâ€êlanguage version of the ADâ€ê8. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of dementia was between 12% and 90% (an average of 38%). What are the implications of this review? The studies included in this review suggest the ADâ€ê8 can identify adults who may have a diagnosis of dementia, who would benefit from specialist assessment and diagnosis. If the ADâ€ê8 was used alone to diagnose dementia, the chance of wrongly diagnosing someone with dementia when they do not actually have it is high (50% of those whose ADâ€ê8 score suggests they have dementia). This makes the ADâ€ê8 an unsuitable single diagnostic test as it would potentially create anxiety and distress. The chance of missing a diagnosis of dementia is much lower (5% of those whose ADâ€ê8 score suggests they do not have dementia when they actually have it). This group will miss out on opportunities to plan their future care and would not be eligible to be assessed for treatment with medicines. These findings should be considered when deciding whether or not to use the ADâ€ê8 to test for dementia. How upâ€êtoâ€êdate is this review?

Cochrane, Interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community," Gillespie, LD;  Robertson, MC;  Gillespie, WJ;  Sherrington, C;  Gates, S;  Clemson, LM;  Lamb, SE"," Abstract - Background Approximately 30% of people over 65 years of age living in the community fall each year. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people living in the community. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (February 2012), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2012), EMBASE (1947 to March 2012), CINAHL (1982 to February 2012), and online trial registers. Selection criteria Randomised trials of interventions to reduce falls in communityâ€êdwelling older people. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used a rate ratio (RaR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare the rate of falls (e.g. falls per person year) between intervention and control groups. For risk of falling, we used a risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI based on the number of people falling (fallers) in each group. We pooled data where appropriate. Main results We included 159 trials with 79,193 participants. Most trials compared a fall prevention intervention with no intervention or an intervention not expected to reduce falls. The most common interventions tested were exercise as a single intervention (59 trials) and multifactorial programmes (40 trials). Sixtyâ€êtwo per cent (99/159) of trials were at low risk of bias for sequence generation, 60% for attrition bias for falls (66/110), 73% for attrition bias for fallers (96/131), and only 38% (60/159) for allocation concealment. Multipleâ€êcomponent group exercise significantly reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82; 16 trials; 3622 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96; 22 trials; 5333 participants), as did multipleâ€êcomponent homeâ€êbased exercise (RaR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80; 7 trials; 951 participants and RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94; 6 trials; 714 participants). For Tai Chi, the reduction in rate of falls bordered on statistical significance (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.00; 5 trials; 1563 participants) but Tai Chi did significantly reduce risk of falling (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; 6 trials; 1625 participants). Overall, exercise interventions significantly reduced the risk of sustaining a fallâ€êrelated fracture (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 6 trials; 810 participants). Multifactorial interventions, which include individual risk assessment, reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86; 19 trials; 9503 participants), but not risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; 34 trials; 13,617 participants). Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; 7 trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Home safety assessment and modification interventions were effective in reducing rate of falls (RaR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97; 6 trials; 4208 participants) and risk of falling (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96; 7 trials; 4051 participants). These interventions were more effective in people at higher risk of falling, including those with severe visual impairment. Home safety interventions appear to be more effective when delivered by an occupational therapist. An intervention to treat vision problems (616 participants) resulted in a significant  increase  in the rate of falls (RaR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.06) and risk of falling (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.91). When regular wearers of multifocal glasses (597 participants) were given single lens glasses, all falls and outside falls were significantly reduced in the subgroup that regularly took part in outside activities. Conversely, there was a significant  increase  in outside falls in intervention group participants who took part in little outside activity. Pacemakers reduced rate of falls in people with carotid sinus hypersensitivity (RaR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93; 3 trials; 349 participants) but not risk of falling. First eye cataract surgery in women reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.95; 1 trial; 306 participants), but second eye cataract surgery did not. Gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medication reduced rate of falls (RaR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.73; 1 trial; 93 participants), but not risk of falling. A prescribing modification programme for primary care physicians significantly reduced risk of falling (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; 1 trial; 659 participants). An antiâ€êslip shoe device reduced rate of falls in icy conditions (RaR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.78; 1 trial; 109 participants). One trial (305 participants) comparing multifaceted podiatry including foot and ankle exercises with standard podiatry in people with disabling foot pain significantly reduced the rate of falls (RaR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91) but not the risk of falling. There is no evidence of effect for cognitive behavioural interventions on rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.72; 1 trial; 120 participants) or risk of falling (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.54; 2 trials; 350 participants). Trials testing interventions to increase knowledge/educate about fall prevention alone did not significantly reduce the rate of falls (RaR 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.20; 1 trial; 45 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.03; 4 trials; 2555 participants). Thirteen trials provided a comprehensive economic evaluation. Three of these indicated cost savings for their interventions during the trial period: homeâ€êbased exercise in over 80â€êyearâ€êolds, home safety assessment and modification in those with a previous fall, and one multifactorial programme targeting eight specific risk factors. Authors' conclusions Group and homeâ€êbased exercise programmes, and home safety interventions reduce rate of falls and risk of falling. Multifactorial assessment and intervention programmes reduce rate of falls but not risk of falling; Tai Chi reduces risk of falling. Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community As people get older, they may fall more often for a variety of reasons including problems with balance, poor vision, and dementia. Up to 30% may fall in a year. Although one in five falls may require medical attention, less than one in 10 results in a fracture. This review looked at the healthcare literature to establish which fall prevention interventions are effective for older people living in the community, and included 159 randomised controlled trials with 79,193 participants.   Group and homeâ€êbased exercise programmes, usually containing some balance and strength training exercises, effectively reduced falls, as did Tai Chi. Overall, exercise programmes aimed at reducing falls appear to reduce fractures. Multifactorial interventions assess an individual's risk of falling, and then carry out treatment or arrange referrals to reduce the identified risks. Overall, current evidence shows that this type of intervention reduces the number of falls in older people living in the community but not the number of people falling during followâ€êup. These are complex interventions, and their effectiveness may be dependent on factors yet to be determined.   Interventions to improve home safety appear to be effective, especially in people at higher risk of falling and when carried out by occupational therapists. An antiâ€êslip shoe device worn in icy conditions can also reduce falls. Taking vitamin D supplements does not appear to reduce falls in most communityâ€êdwelling older people, but may do so in those who have lower vitamin D levels in the blood before treatment.   Some medications increase the risk of falling. Three trials in this review failed to reduce the number of falls by reviewing and adjusting medications. A fourth trial involving family physicians and their patients in medication review was effective in reducing falls. Gradual withdrawal of a particular type of drug for improving sleep, reducing anxiety, and treating depression (psychotropic medication) has been shown to reduce falls. Cataract surgery reduces falls in women having the operation on the first affected eye. Insertion of a pacemaker can reduce falls in people with frequent falls associated with carotid sinus hypersensitivity, a condition which causes sudden changes in heart rate and blood pressure. In people with disabling foot pain, the addition of footwear assessment, customised insoles, and foot and ankle exercises to regular podiatry reduced the number of falls but not the number of people falling. The evidence relating to the provision of educational materials alone for preventing falls is inconclusive.",2012,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,9,, CD007146, 10.1002/14651858.CD007146.pub3,,#26,Gillespie 2012
Cochrane, Driving assessment for maintaining mobility and safety in drivers with dementia," Martin, AJ;  Marottoli, R;  O'Neill, D"," Abstract - Background Demographic changes are leading to an increase in the number of older drivers: as dementia is an ageâ€êrelated disease, there is also an increase in the numbers of drivers with dementia. Dementia can impact on both the mobility and safety of drivers, and the impact of formal assessment of driving is unknown in terms of either mobility or safety. Those involved in assessment of older drivers need to be aware of the evidence of positive and negative effects of driving assessment. Cognitive tests are felt by some authors to have poor face and construct validity for assessing driving performance; extrapolating from values in one largeâ€êscale prospective cohort study, the cognitive test that most strongly predicted future crashes would, if used as a screening tool, potentially prevent six crashes per 1000 people over 65 years of age screened, but at the price of stopping the driving of 121 people who would not have had a crash. Objectives Primary objectives:â€¨ 1. to assess whether driving assessment facilitates continued driving in people with dementia;â€¨ 2. to assess whether driving assessment reduces accidents in people with dementia. Secondary objective:â€¨ 1. to assess the quality of research on assessment of drivers with dementia. Search methods ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia Group's Specialized Register was searched on 13 September 2012 using the terms: driving or driver* or ""motor vehicle*"" or ""car accident*"" or ""traffic accident*"" or automobile* or traffic. This register contains records from major healthcare databases, ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources and is updated regularly. Selection criteria We sought randomised controlled trials prospectively evaluating drivers with dementia for outcomes such as transport mobility, driving cessation or motor vehicle accidents following driving assessment. Data collection and analysis Each review author retrieved studies and assessed for primary and secondary outcomes, study design and study quality. Main results No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. A description and discussion of the driving literature relating to assessment of drivers with dementia relating to the primary objectives is presented. Authors' conclusions In an area with considerable public health impact for drivers with dementia and other road users, the available literature fails to demonstrate the benefit of driver assessment for either preserving transport mobility or reducing motor vehicle accidents. Driving legislation and recommendations from medical practitioners requires further research that addresses these outcomes in order to provide the best outcomes for both drivers with dementia and the general public. Plain language summary Driving assessment for maintaining mobility and safety in drivers with dementia The proportion of older people in the world is increasing and consequently the number of older drivers is also on the rise. Older people commonly depend upon private motor vehicles for their transport needs and so assessment of older drivers with cognitive impairment is becoming increasingly important. We have reviewed the literature on driving assessment in people with dementia for two reasons. First, we wished to see if assessment helped people with dementia and good driving skills continue driving. Second, we wished to discover whether assessment was useful in preventing road traffic accidents. Although many authors have studied the motor skills, neuropsychological performance and driving behaviour of drivers with dementia, we found no study that randomised drivers to evaluate these outcomes prospectively following assessment. This highlights the need for caution in applying the literature on driving assessment to clinical settings as no benefit has yet been prospectively demonstrated. It also indicates the need for prospective evaluation of new and existing models of driver assessment to best preserve transport mobility and minimise road traffic accidents.",2013,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,8,, CD006222, 10.1002/14651858.CD006222.pub4,,#24,Martin 2013
Cochrane, Structural magnetic resonance imaging for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment," Lombardi, G;  Crescioli, G;  Cavedo, E;  Lucenteforte, E;  Casazza, G;  Bellatorre, AG;  Lista, C;  Costantino, G;  Frisoni, G;  Virgili, G;  et al."," Abstract - Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease is the symptomatic predementia phase of Alzheimer's disease dementia, characterised by cognitive and functional impairment not severe enough to fulfil the criteria for dementia. In clinical samples, people with amnestic MCI are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia, with annual rates of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's disease estimated at approximately 10% to 15% compared with the base incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease dementia of 1% to 2% per year. Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI versus the clinical followâ€êup diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia as a reference standard (delayed verification). To investigate sources of heterogeneity in accuracy, such as the use of qualitative visual assessment or quantitative volumetric measurements, including manual or automatic (MRI) techniques, or the length of followâ€êup, and age of participants. MRI was evaluated as an addâ€êon test in addition to clinical diagnosis of MCI to improve early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. Search methods On 29 January 2019 we searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement's Specialised Register and the databases, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO, and LILACS. We also searched the reference lists of all eligible studies identified by the electronic searches. Selection criteria We considered cohort studies of any size that included prospectively recruited people of any age with a diagnosis of MCI. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of baseline structural MRI versus the clinical followâ€êup diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia (delayed verification). We did not exclude studies on the basis of length of followâ€êup. We included studies that used either qualitative visual assessment or quantitative volumetric measurements of MRI to detect atrophy in the whole brain or in specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, lateral ventricles, entorhinal cortex, medial temporal gyrus, lateral temporal lobe, amygdala, and cortical grey matter. Data collection and analysis Four teams of two review authors each independently reviewed titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy. Two teams of two review authors each independently assessed the selected fullâ€êtext articles for eligibility, extracted data and solved disagreements by consensus. Two review authors independently assessed the quality of studies using the QUADASâ€ê2 tool. We used the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model to fit summary ROC curves and to obtain overall measures of relative accuracy in subgroup analyses. We also used these models to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Main results We included 33 studies, published from 1999 to 2019, with 3935 participants of whom 1341 (34%) progressed to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 2594 (66%) did not. Of the participants who did not progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia, 2561 (99%) remained stable MCI and 33 (1%) progressed to other types of dementia. The median proportion of women was 53% and the mean age of participants ranged from 63 to 87 years (median 73 years). The mean length of clinical followâ€êup ranged from 1 to 7.6 years (median 2 years). Most studies were of poor methodological quality due to risk of bias for participant selection or the index test, or both. Most of the included studies reported data on the volume of the total hippocampus (pooled mean sensitivity 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.80); pooled mean specificity 0.71 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.77); 22 studies, 2209 participants). This evidence was of low certainty due to risk of bias and inconsistency. Seven studies reported data on the atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (mean sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.73); mean specificity 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.76); 1077 participants) and five studies on the volume of the lateral ventricles (mean sensitivity 0.57 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.65); mean specificity 0.64 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.70); 1077 participants). This evidence was of moderate certainty due to risk of bias. Four studies with 529 participants analysed the volume of the total entorhinal cortex and four studies with 424 participants analysed the volume of the whole brain. We did not estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the volume of these two regions because available data were sparse and heterogeneous. We could not statistically evaluate the volumes of the lateral temporal lobe, amygdala, medial temporal gyrus, or cortical grey matter assessed in small individual studies. We found no evidence of a difference between studies in the accuracy of the total hippocampal volume with regards to duration of followâ€êup or age of participants, but the manual MRI technique was superior to automatic techniques in mixed (mostly indirect) comparisons. We did not assess the relative accuracy of the volumes of different brain regions measured by MRI because only indirect comparisons were available, studies were heterogeneous, and the overall accuracy of all regions was moderate. Authors' conclusions The volume of hippocampus or medial temporal lobe, the most studied brain regions, showed low sensitivity and specificity and did not qualify structural MRI as a standâ€êalone addâ€êon test for an early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. This is consistent with international guidelines, which recommend imaging to exclude nonâ€êdegenerative or surgical causes of cognitive impairment and not to diagnose dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future research should not focus on a single biomarker, but rather on combinations of biomarkers to improve an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Plain language summary How accurate is magnetic resonance imaging for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment? Why is improving Alzheimer ' s disease diagnosis important? Cognitive impairment is when people have problems remembering, learning, concentrating and making decisions. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) generally have more memory problems than other people of their age, but these problems are not severe enough to be classified as dementia. Studies have shown that people with MCI and loss of memory are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease dementia (approximately 10% to 15% of cases per year) than people without MCI (1% to 2% per year). Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease dementia is to follow people with MCI and assess cognitive changes over the years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may detect changes in the brain structures that indicate the beginning of Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis of MCI due to Alzheimer's disease is important because people with MCI could benefit from early treatment to prevent or delay cognitive decline. What was the aim of this review? To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. What was studied in the review? The volume of several brain regions was measured with MRI. Most studies (22 studies, 2209 participants) measured the volume of the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is associated primarily with memory. What are the main results in this review? Thirtyâ€êthree studies were eligible, in which 3935 participants with MCI were included and followed up for two or three years to see if they developed Alzheimer's disease dementia. About a third of them converted to Alzheimer's disease dementia, and the others did not or developed other types of dementia. We found that MRI is not accurate enough to identify people with MCI who will develop dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The correct prediction of Alzheimer's disease would be missed in 81 out of 300 people with MCI (false negatives) and a wrong prediction of Alzheimer's disease would be made in 203 out of 700 people with MCI (false positives). As a result, people with a falseâ€ênegative diagnosis would be falsely reassured and would not prepare themselves to cope with Alzheimer's disease, while those with a falseâ€êpositive diagnosis would suffer from the wrongly anticipated diagnosis. How reliable are the results of the studies? The included studies diagnosed Alzheimer's disease dementia by assessing all participants with standard clinical criteria after two or three years' followâ€êup. We had some concerns about how the studies were conducted, since the participants were mainly selected from clinical registries and referral centres, and we also had concerns about how studies interpreted MRI. Moreover, the studies were conducted differently from each other, and they used different methods to select people with MCI and perform MRI. Who do the results of this review apply to? The results do not apply to people with MCI in the community, but only to people with MCI who attend memory clinics or referral centres. What are the implications of this review? MRI, as a single test, is not accurate for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI since one in three or four participants received a wrong diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Future research should not focus on a single test (such as MRI), but rather on combinations of tests to improve an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia. How up to date is this review?

Cochrane, Cholinesterase inhibitors for mild cognitive impairment," Russ, TC;  Morling, JR"," Abstract - Background Mild cognitive impairment is hypothesised to represent a preâ€êclinical stage of dementia but forms a heterogeneous group with variable prognosis. Objectives To assess the safety and efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods Trials were identified from the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, which is frequently updated from the major healthcare databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Lilacs) as well as trial registers and grey literature. Selection criteria Doubleâ€êblind, placeboâ€êcontrolled randomised trials of any cholinesterase inhibitor in people with mild cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the published reports of the included studies, combined by metaâ€êanalysis where appropriate, and treatment efficacy and risk of adverse events were estimated. Main results Nine studies (from eight published reports) of 5149 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (however defined) were included in the review. Limited pooling of results was possible owing to different lengths of trials. Metaâ€êanalysis of the three studies reporting conversion to dementia gives no strong evidence of a beneficial effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the progression to dementia at one, two or three years. The risk ratio (RR) for conversion at two years was significantly different from unity (0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.83), but this is based on only two studies reported in the same article. There was essentially no effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive test scores. Based on the results from 4207 individuals, there were significantly more adverse events in the cholinesterase inhibitor groups (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16), but no more serious adverse events or deaths. Gastrointestinal side effects were much more common (diarrhoea: RR 2.10; 95% CI 1.30 to 3.39; nausea: RR 2.97; 95% CI 2.57 to 3.42; vomiting: RR 4.42; 95% CI 3.23 to 6.05). Cardiac problems were no more likely in either group (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.25 to 2.02). Other side effects reported significantly more often in the cholinesterase inhibitor group were muscle spasms/leg cramps (RR 7.52; 95% CI 4.34 to 13.02), headache (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.71), syncope or dizziness (RR 1.62; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.93), insomnia (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.02) and abnormal dreams (RR 4.25; 95% CI 2.57 to 7.04). Authors' conclusions There is very little evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors affect progression to dementia or cognitive test scores in mild cognitive impairment. This weak evidence is overwhelmed by the increased risk of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal. Cholinesterase inhibitors should not be recommended for mild cognitive impairment. Plain language summary Antiâ€êdementia drugs for people with memory problems but without dementia Dementia is a very common condition and, with ageing populations, will only increase in importance in the coming years. Early diagnosis and treatment help people with dementia stay independent and living at home for longer. Cholinesterase inhibitor ('antiâ€êdementia') drugs are used to treat people with Alzheimer's disease (the most common cause of dementia) and can be started as soon as dementia is diagnosed. However, it is not clear whether they are helpful, or indeed safe, in people who have some memory problems but who do not have dementia. It is extremely difficult to predict who will go on to develop dementia from this group of people and some will even get better and their memory return to normal. There is very little evidence that these drugs prevent the development of dementia over three years and people taking them experience a number of side effects including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, as well as muscle spasms/leg cramps and abnormal dreams.",2012,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,9,, CD009132, 10.1002/14651858.CD009132.pub2,,#21,Russ 2012
Cochrane, Modifying the consistency of food and fluids for swallowing difficulties in dementia," Flynn, E;  Smith, CH;  Walsh, CD;  Walshe, M"," Abstract - Background People with dementia can have feeding and swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Modification of the consistency of food or fluids, or both, is a common management strategy. However, diet modification can affect quality of life and may lead to dehydration and malnutrition. Evidence on the benefits and risks of modifying food and fluids is mandatory to improve the care of people with dementia and dysphagia. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with modifying the consistency of food and fluids in improving oral intake and eliminating aspiration in adults with dysphagia and dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid SP, Embase via Ovid SP, PsycINFO via Ovid SP, CINAHL via EBSCOhost, LILACS via BIREME, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 9 May 2018. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify any additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasiâ€êRCTs and clusterâ€êRCTs published in any language that measured any of the outcomes of interest. We included trials with adults with a clinical diagnosis of dementia with symptoms and signs of dysphagia confirmed on instrumental assessment. We included participants with all types, stages and severities of dementia. Control groups received either no intervention or interventions not involving diet modification or modification to sensory properties of food. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified. Data were extracted independently along with assessment of methodological quality using standard Cochrane methods. We contacted study authors for additional unpublished information. Main results No trials on modification of food met the inclusion criteria. We included two studies that examined modification to fluids. Both were part of the same large multicentre trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. Participation in the second trial was determined by results from the first trial. With unpublished data supplied by study authors, we examined data from participants with dementia only. The first study, a crossâ€êover trial, investigated the immediate effects on aspiration of two viscosities of liquids (nectar thick and honey thick) compared to regular liquids in 351 participants with dementia using videofluoroscopy. Regular liquids with a chin down head posture, as well as regular liquids without any intervention were also compared. The sequence of interventions during videofluoroscopy may have influenced response to intervention. The second study, a parallel designed RCT, compared the effect of nectar and honey thick liquids with a chin down head posture over a threeâ€êmonth period in a subgroup of 260 participants with dementia. Outcomes were pneumonia and adverse intervention effects. Honey thick liquids, which are more consistent with descriptors for 'spoon thick' or 'extremely thick' liquids, showed a more positive impact on immediate elimination of aspiration during videofluoroscopy, but this consistency showed more adverse effects in the second followâ€êup study. During the second threeâ€êmonth followâ€êup trial, there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia in participants receiving honey thick liquids than those receiving nectar thick liquids or taking regular liquids with a chin down posture. There were no deaths classified as 'definitely related' to the type of fluids prescribed. Neither trial addressed quality of life. Risk of bias for both studies is high. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes in this review is low. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain about the immediate and longâ€êterm effects of modifying the consistency of fluid for swallowing difficulties in dementia as too few studies have been completed. There may be differences in outcomes depending on the grade of thickness of fluids and the sequence of interventions trialled in videofluoroscopy for people with dementia. Clinicians should be aware that while thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallowing, the longâ€êterm impact of thickened fluids on the health of the person with dementia should be considered. Further highâ€êquality clinical trials are required. Plain language summary Modifying the consistency of food and fluids for swallowing difficulties in dementia Background Individuals with dementia often present with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). The consequences can include choking, dehydration, malnutrition, weight loss, pneumonia and death. Modification of food and liquid is a popular management strategy. It is believed that increasing the viscosity of liquids or altering the consistency of food allows individuals a better opportunity to swallow, with a reduced risk of choking or liquids entering the airway. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that this strategy can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, negative psychological/social consequences, and can affect quality of life for the person with dementia. Review question We wished to find out if changing the viscosity or consistency of food or fluids, or both, makes swallowing safer and has positive outcomes for people with dementia in terms of respiratory status, nutritional status and quality of life. We wanted to examine if modifying food or fluids, or both, also had any adverse effects for the person with dementia. Study characteristics We found two studies, which were both part of the same multicentre trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. We included data on people with dementia only. The first of the two studies looked at the immediate effects of two viscosities of liquids compared to regular thin liquids on aspiration (entry of food or fluid into the lungs) in 351 people with dementia. This study also compared drinking regular thin liquids using a chin down head posture as well as drinking regular thin liquids without any changes to head position; the main outcome was fluid entering the lungs. Using a subgroup of 260 people with dementia from the first study, the second study compared the effect of the same liquid viscosities with a chin down head posture. The effectiveness of these interventions on the incidence of pneumonia and adverse effects of these interventions was examined over a threeâ€êmonth period. Study results Honey thick viscosity liquids, which clinically are similar to descriptions of 'very thick liquids', had a more positive immediate impact on preventing fluid entering the lungs when examined during videofluoroscopy (specialised swallow xâ€êray) examination. However, during the threeâ€êmonth followâ€êup period there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia in the group of people with dementia receiving these honey thick liquids, than those receiving nectar thick liquids and those receiving regular thin liquids with a chin down posture. There were no deaths classified as 'definitely related' to the type of liquids that the person with dementia was receiving. Conclusion There were a number of methodological flaws in both studies in this review and these were acknowledged by the authors. While thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallow function, clinicians should consider the effects of this intervention on the person with dementia in the longerâ€êterm. People with dementia on thickened fluids require longâ€êterm followâ€êup. The overall risk of bias of included studies is high. The quality of evidence is low. Further wellâ€êdesigned research is needed.",2018,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,9,, CD011077, 10.1002/14651858.CD011077.pub2,,#19,Flynn 2018
Cochrane, Enhanced rehabilitation and care models for adults with dementia following hip fracture surgery," Smith, TO;  Gilbert, AW;  Sreekanta, A;  Sahota, O;  Griffin, XL;  Cross, JL;  Fox, C;  Lamb, SE"," Abstract - Background Hip fracture is a major injury that causes significant problems for affected individuals and their family and carers. Over 40% of people with hip fracture have dementia or cognitive impairment. The outcomes of these individuals after surgery are poorer than for those without dementia. It is unclear which care and rehabilitation interventions achieve the best outcomes for these people. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013. Objectives (a) To assess the effectiveness of models of care including enhanced rehabilitation strategies designed specifically for people with dementia following hip fracture surgery compared to usual care. (b) To assess for people with dementia the effectiveness of models of care including enhanced rehabilitation strategies that are designed for all older people, regardless of cognitive status, following hip fracture surgery, compared to usual care. Search methods We searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 16 October 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasiâ€êrandomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of any model of enhanced care and rehabilitation for people with dementia after hip fracture surgery compared to usual care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We synthesised data only if we considered the trials to be sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions, and outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included seven trials with a total of 555 participants. Three trials compared models of enhanced care in the inpatient setting with conventional care. Two trials compared an enhanced care model provided in inpatient settings and at home after discharge with conventional care. Two trials compared geriatricianâ€êled care inâ€êhospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team. None of the interventions were designed specifically for people with dementia, therefore the data included in the review were from subgroups of people with dementia or cognitive impairment participating in randomised controlled trials investigating models of care for all older people following hip fracture. The end of followâ€êup in the trials ranged from the point of acute hospital discharge to 24 months after discharge. We considered all trials to be at high risk of bias in more than one domain. As subgroups of larger trials, the analyses lacked power to detect differences between the intervention groups. Furthermore, there were some important differences in baseline characteristics of participants between the experimental and control groups. Using the GRADE approach, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to low or very low. The effect estimates for almost all comparisons were very imprecise, and the overall certainty for most results was very low. There were no data from any study for our primary outcome of healthâ€êrelated quality of life. There was only very low certainty for our other primary outcome, activities of daily living and functional performance, therefore we were unable to draw any conclusions with confidence. There was lowâ€êcertainty that enhanced care and rehabilitation inâ€êhospital may reduce rates of postoperative delirium (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.22, 2 trials, n = 141) and very lowâ€êcertainty associating it with lower rates of some other complications. There was also lowâ€êcertainty that, compared to orthopaedicâ€êled management, geriatricianâ€êled management may lead to shorter hospital stays (mean difference 4.00 days, 95% CI 3.61 to 4.39, 1 trial, n = 162). Authors' conclusions We found limited evidence that some of the models of enhanced rehabilitation and care used in the included trials may show benefits over usual care for preventing delirium and reducing length of stay for people with dementia who have been treated for hip fracture. However, the certainty of these results is low. Data were available from only a small number of trials, and the certainty for all other results is very low. Determining the optimal strategies to improve outcomes for this growing population of patients should be a research priority. Plain language summary Rehabilitation for people with dementia following a hip fracture operation Background Hip fracture is an injury primarily of elderly people, which is usually caused by a fall. It can affect a person's ability to walk, perform activities of daily living, and remain independent. Hip fracture is more common in people with dementia, and these individuals can find it more difficult to recover because they are at greater risk of becoming more confused and developing additional complications such as pressure sores and chest infections after surgery. They may also find it more difficult to express pain and discomfort. Review question We wanted to learn whether different ways of treating people with dementia following hip fracture might affect how well they recover and what the associated costs of their recovery might be. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review. Study characteristics We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) that compared any model of enhanced care and rehabilitation for people with dementia after hip fracture versus the usual care provided in the trial setting. The latest search was performed on 16 October 2019. We identified seven trials that studied a total of 555 people with dementia following hip fracture. Five trials compared an enhanced interdisciplinary rehabilitation and care programme where the various healthcare professionals worked collaboratively across hospital and community settings or just in hospital, to usual hospital care. Two trials compared care inâ€êhospital led by a geriatrician versus care led by an orthopaedic surgeon. Key findings People with dementia who receive enhanced care and rehabilitation in hospital after a hip fracture may be less likely to develop delirium. When care is led by a geriatrician, they may have stays in hospital that are three to four days shorter than if care is led by an orthopaedic surgeon. There was no information on the effect of any of the care models on quality of life, and we could not be certain about their effects on other important outcomes such as an individual's ability to manage their daily activities, regaining mobility, cognitive function, pain, death rates, or the likelihood of the person returning to the same place they had been living before the fracture. Quality of the evidence The main issues with the evidence were that most of the studies were small and their results may have been subject to bias. Most of the results of the review are very uncertain. None of the care models had been designed specifically for people with dementia. All of the data included in the review came from people with dementia who had been included in larger trials for all older people with hip fractures, although people with dementia may have particular needs. Conclusions There may be some benefits from the care models studied, but the currently available research is insufficient to determine the best ways to care for people with dementia after a hip fracture operation.",2020,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,2,, CD010569, 10.1002/14651858.CD010569.pub3,,#18,Smith 2020
Cochrane, Vitamin and mineral supplementation for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in mid and late life," Rutjes, AWS;  Denton, DA;  Di Nisio, M;  Chong, LY;  Abraham, RP;  Alâ€êAssaf, AS;  Anderson, JL;  Malik, MA;  Vernooij, RWM;  MartÃ_nez, G;  et al."," Abstract - Background Vitamins and minerals play multiple functions within the central nervous system which may help to maintain brain health and optimal cognitive functioning. Supplementation of the diet with various vitamins and minerals has been suggested as a means of maintaining cognitive function, or even of preventing dementia, in later life. Objectives To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people aged 40 years or more. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groupâ€™s (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP from inception to 26th January 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the cognitive effects on people aged 40 years or more of any vitamin or mineral supplements taken by mouth for at least three months. Data collection and analysis Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were done in duplicate. Vitamins were considered broadly in the categories of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and combinations of both. Minerals were considered separately, where possible. If interventions and outcomes were considered sufficiently similar, then data were pooled. In order to separate shortâ€êterm cognitive effects from possible longerâ€êterm effects on the trajectory of cognitive decline, data were pooled for various treatment durations from 3 months to 12 months and up to 10 years or more. Main results In total, we included 28 studies with more than 83,000 participants. There were some general limitations of the evidence. Most participants were enrolled in studies which were not designed primarily to assess cognition. These studies often had no baseline cognitive assessment and used only brief cognitive assessments at followâ€êup. Very few studies assessed the incidence of dementia. Most study reports did not mention adverse events or made only very general statements about them. Only 10 studies had a mean followâ€êup > 5 years. Only two studies had participants whose mean age was < 60 years at baseline. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally low, other than a risk of attrition bias for longerâ€êterm outcomes. We considered the certainty of the evidence behind almost all results to be moderate or low. We included 14 studies with 27,882 participants which compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these to placebo. The majority of participants were aged over 60 years and had a history of cardioâ€ê or cerebrovascular disease. We found that giving B vitamin supplements to cognitively healthy adults, mainly in their 60s and 70s, probably has little or no effect on global cognitive function at any time point up to 5 years (SMD values from â€ê0.03 to 0.06) and may also have no effect at 5â€ê10 years (SMD â€ê0.01). There were very sparse data on adverse effects or on incidence of cognitive impairment or dementia. We included 8 studies with 47,840 participants in which the active intervention was one or more of the antioxidant vitamins: ï¿_ï¿_â€êcarotene, vitamin C or vitamin E. Results were mixed. For overall cognitive function, there was lowâ€êcertainty evidence of benefit associated with ÃŸâ€êcarotene after a mean of 18 years of treatment (MD 0.18 TICS points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35) and of vitamin C after 5 years to 10 years (MD 0.46 TICS points, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78), but not at earlier time points. From two studies which reported on dementia incidence, there was lowâ€êcertainty evidence of no effect of an antioxidant vitamin combination or of vitamin E, either alone or combined with selenium. One of the included studies had been designed to look for effects on the incidence of prostate cancer; it found a statistically significant increase in prostate cancer diagnoses among men taking vitamin E. One trial with 4143 participants compared vitamin D3 (400 IU/day) and calcium supplements to placebo. We found lowâ€ê to moderateâ€êcertainty evidence of no effect of vitamin D3 and calcium supplements at any timeâ€êpoint up to 10 years on overall cognitive function (MD after a mean of 7.8 years â€ê0.1 MMSE points, 95% CI â€ê0.81 to 0.61) or the incidence of dementia (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24). A pilot study with 60 participants used a higher dose of vitamin D3 (4000 IU on alternate days) and found preliminary evidence that this dose probably has no effect on cognitive function over six months. We included data from one trial of zinc and copper supplementation with 1072 participants. There was moderateâ€êcertainty evidence of little or no effect on overall cognitive function (MD 0.6 MMSE points, 95% CI â€ê0.19 to 1.39) or on the incidence of cognitive impairment after 5 years to 10 years. A second smaller trial provided no usable data, but reported no cognitive effects of six months of supplementation with zinc gluconate. From one study with 3711 participants, there was lowâ€êcertainty evidence of no effect of approximately five years of selenium supplementation on the incidence of dementia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13). Finally, we included three trials of complex supplements (combinations of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals) with 6306 participants. From the one trial which assessed overall cognitive function, there was lowâ€êcertainty evidence of little or no effect on the TICS (MD after a mean of 8.5 years 0.12, 95% CI â€ê0.14 to 0.38). Authors' conclusions We did not find evidence that any vitamin or mineral supplementation strategy for cognitively healthy adults in mid or late life has a meaningful effect on cognitive decline or dementia, although the evidence does not permit definitive conclusions. There were very few data on supplementation starting in midlife (< 60 years); studies designed to assess cognitive outcomes tended to be too short to assess maintenance of cognitive function; longer studies often had other primary outcomes and used cognitive measures which may have lacked sensitivity. The only positive signals of effect came from studies of longâ€êterm supplementation with antioxidant vitamins. These may be the most promising for further research. Plain language summary Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing cognitive deterioration in cognitively healthy people in mid and late life Review question This review aimed to find out whether people aged 40 years or older could maintain their mental abilities or reduce their risk of dementia by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Background There is great interest in anything people might do to keep themselves mentally healthy as they age and, especially, to reduce their risk of developing dementia. Various vitamin and mineral supplements have been suggested as ways to do this. Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the body and the ways they might affect brain health are not well understood. Therefore, we were interested in the effects of any vitamins or minerals, either alone or in combination. What we did We searched up to January 2018 for all trials which had studied the effect on cognition (thinking and remembering) of any vitamin or mineral supplements in people aged 40 years or more who had no cognitive problems at the beginning of the study. The studies had to include a comparison group which had not taken the supplement being studied and, to be sure the comparison was fair, it should have been decided at random whether people got the supplement or not. What we found We grouped the 28 included trials according to the kind of supplement they used and how it might work. Most of the trials were not originally designed to study cognition or dementia and used only simple measures of cognition. Very few studies investigated whether participants developed dementia. Longâ€êterm studies are probably needed to find effects on the risk of dementia or cognitive decline but only 10 studies had an average length of followâ€êup longer than five years. The studies were generally wellâ€êconducted although the longer trials had difficulty following up all of the participants and this could have biased some of the longerâ€êterm results. There were 14 trials of B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12) with nearly 28,000 participants, mainly in their 60s and 70s. Most of these trials were quite short (less than two years). We found no evidence that B vitamins had any effect on cognition. There were 8 trials of antioxidant vitamins (betaâ€êcarotene/vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E) with approximately 47,000 participants. These trials tended to be longer than the B vitamin trials so may have had more chance of detecting effects on dementia and cognitive decline. The results were mixed. We found lowâ€êcertainty evidence of better overall cognitive function after an average of 18 years taking betaâ€êcarotene and after five years to 10 years taking vitamin C, but no effects after shorter periods of treatment. There were also small benefits of betaâ€êcarotene, vitamin C, and antioxidant combinations on memory at some time points but not others. There was no evidence of any benefits from vitamin E alone. Two studies examined the risk of developing dementia. One found no effect of a combination of antioxidant vitamins and the other found no effect of vitamin E, either alone or combined with the mineral selenium. Most of the studies did not report any information about harmful effects. One included trial was designed to look for an effect on the risk of prostate cancer; it found a higher risk among the men taking vitamin E. There was a small trial of vitamin D supplements which found they probably had no effect on cognition over six months. There were longer trials of vitamin D with calcium (one trial), zinc and copper (one trial), and complex multivitamins (three trials). All lasted between five and 10 years, but none of them found any evidence of beneficial effects on cognition. One trial found no effect of selenium taken for approximately five years on the risk of developing dementia. Conclusions We found no good evidence to suggest that middleâ€êaged or older people can preserve cognitive function or prevent dementia by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. There were a few positive results associated with longâ€êterm use of antioxidant vitamins, particularly betaâ€êcarotene and vitamin C, although the effects were small. Further research into the effects of these vitamins may be worthwhile.",2018,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,12,, CD011906, 10.1002/14651858.CD011906.pub2,,#13,Rutjes 2018
Cochrane, Interventions for preventing and reducing the use of physical restraints in longâ€êterm geriatric care," MÃ¶hler, R;  Richter, T;  KÃ¶pke, S;  Meyer, G"," Abstract - Background Physical restraints (PR) are commonly used in geriatric longâ€êterm care. Restraintâ€êfree care should be the aim of high quality nursing care. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints in older people who require longâ€êterm nursing care (either in community nursing care or in residential care facilities). Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groupâ€™s Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, a number of trial registers and grey literature sources were searched on 7 September 2009. The following search terms were used: ""physical restraint*"", bedrail*, bedchair*, ""containment measure*, elderly, ""old people"", geriatric*, aged, ""nursing home*"", ""care home*"", ""geriatric care"", ""residential facilit*"". Selection criteria Individual or clusterâ€êrandomised controlled trials comparing an intervention aimed at reducing the use of physical restraints with usual care in longâ€êterm geriatric care settings. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality and extracted data. Critical appraisal of studies addressed risk of bias through selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias, as well as critera related to cluster designa. We contacted study authors for additional information where necessary. PR were defined heterogeneously throughout the studies. Not all studies offered sufficient data for aggregated data metaâ€êanalysis, and therefore study results are presented in a narrative form. Main results Five clusterâ€êrandomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. All of them investigated educational approaches. Two studies offered consultation in addition and two other studies offered guidance for nursing staff in addition. Four studies examined nursing home residents and one study residents in group dwelling units. No studies in community settings were included. Three studies included only one or two nursing homes per study condition. Overall, methodological quality of studies was low. The studies revealed inconsistent results. One study in the nursing home setting documented an increase of PR use in both groups after eight months, while the other three studies found reduced use of PR in the intervention groups after seven and 12 months of follow up respectively. The single study examining residents in group dwelling units found no change in PR use in the intervention group after six months whereas PR use increased significantly in the control group. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence supporting the effectiveness of educational interventions targeting nursing staff for preventing or reducing the use of physical restraints in geriatric longâ€êterm care. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing and reducing the use of physical restraints in longâ€êterm geriatric care In geriatric longâ€êterm care, physical restraints (PR) such as bedrails and belts in bed or chair are commonly used. Nurses justify them as safety measures, primarily for the prevention of falls, for controlling disruptive behaviour and for the safe use of medical devices. However, it is questionable whether PR are effective and safe devices. There is evidence of various adverse effects such as injuries, reduced psychological wellâ€êbeing or decreased mobility related to the use of PR. Therefore, restraintâ€êfree care should be the aim of high quality nursing care. We reviewed whether interventions aimed at preventing and reducing the use of PR in geriatric longâ€êterm care settings are effective. We identified five smallâ€êsized randomised controlled studies suitable for inclusion. All studies examined educational interventions targeted at nursing staff. Four studies investigated residents in nursing homes and one in group dwelling units. The methodological quality of all studies was limited. Results of the studies were inconsistent. One study with higher methodological quality showed no reduction in PR use. Three other studies with lower methodological quality found their intervention to be effective. Thus, current evidence on interventions for the reduction or prevention of PR use in longâ€êterm geriatric care does not support a clear conclusion. Ongoing and unpublished research might alter the results of the review.",2011,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,2,, CD007546, 10.1002/14651858.CD007546.pub2,,#10,MÃ¶hler 2011
Cochrane, Aerobic exercise to improve cognitive function in older people without known cognitive impairment," Young, J;  Angevaren, M;  Rusted, J;  Tabet, N"," Abstract - Background There is increasing evidence that physical activity supports healthy ageing. Exercise is helpful for cardiovascular, respiratory and musculoskeletal systems, among others. Aerobic activity, in particular, improves cardiovascular fitness and, based on recently reported findings, may also have beneficial effects on cognition among older people. Objectives To assess the effect of aerobic physical activity, aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness, on cognitive function in older people without known cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS â€ê the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 2 of 4, 2013), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (Ovid SP 1974 to August 2013), PEDro, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to August 2013), CINAHL (all dates to August 2013), LILACS (all dates to August 2013), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov) and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to 24 August 2013, with no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect on cognitive function of aerobic physical activity programmes with any other active intervention, or no intervention, in cognitively healthy participants aged over 55 years. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted the data from included trials. We grouped cognitive outcome measures into eleven categories covering attention, memory, perception, executive functions, cognitive inhibition, cognitive speed and motor function. We used the mean difference (or standardised mean difference) between groups as the measure of the treatment effect and synthesised data using a randomâ€êeffects model. We conducted separate analyses to compare aerobic exercise interventions with no intervention and with other exercise, social or cognitive interventions. Also, we performed analyses including only trials in which an increase in the cardiovascular fitness of participants had been demonstrated. Main results Twelve trials including 754 participants met our inclusion criteria. Trials were from eight to 26 weeks in duration. We judged all trials to be at moderate or high risk of bias in at least some domains. Reporting of some risk of bias domains was poor. Our analyses comparing aerobic exercise to any active intervention showed no evidence of benefit from aerobic exercise in any cognitive domain. This was also true of our analyses comparing aerobic exercise to no intervention. Analysing only the subgroup of trials in which cardiorespiratory fitness improved in the aerobic exercise group showed that this improvement did not coincide with improvements in any cognitive domains assessed. Our subgroup analyses of aerobic exercise versus flexibility or balance interventions also showed no benefit of aerobic exercise in any cognitive domain. Dropout rates did not differ between aerobic exercise and control groups. No trial reported on adverse effects. Overall none of our analyses showed a cognitive benefit from aerobic exercise even when the intervention was shown to lead to improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence in the available data from RCTs that aerobic physical activities, including those which successfully improve cardiorespiratory fitness, have any cognitive benefit in cognitively healthy older adults. Larger studies examining possible moderators are needed to confirm whether or not aerobic training improves cognition. Plain language summary Aerobic exercise to improve cognitive function in older people without known cognitive impairment Aerobic exercise is beneficial for healthy ageing. It has been suggested that the increased fitness brought about by aerobic exercise may help to maintain good cognitive function in older age. We looked for randomised controlled trials of aerobic exercise programmes for people over the age of 55 years, without preâ€êexisting cognitive problems, which measured effects on both fitness and cognition. The aerobic exercise programmes could be compared with no intervention (e.g. being on a waiting list for the exercise group) or with other kinds of activity (including nonâ€êaerobic exercises such as strength or balance exercises, or social activities). In this Cochrane Review, 12 trials including 754 participants met our inclusion criteria. Eight of the 12 trials reported that the aerobic exercise interventions resulted in increased fitness of the trained group. However, when we combined results across the trials, we did not find any significant benefits of aerobic exercise or increased fitness on any aspect of cognition. Many included trials had problems with their methods or reporting which reduced our confidence in the findings. We did not find evidence that aerobic exercise or increased fitness improves cognitive function in older people. However, it remains possible that it may be helpful for particular subgroups of people, or that more intense exercise programmes could be beneficial. Therefore further research in this area is necessary.",2015,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,4,, CD005381, 10.1002/14651858.CD005381.pub4,,#8,Young 2015
Cochrane, Pharmacological interventions for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome," Livingstone, N;  Hanratty, J;  McShane, R;  Macdonald, G"," Abstract - Background People with Down syndrome are vulnerable to developing dementia at an earlier age than the general population. Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome can place a significant burden on both the person with Down syndrome and their family and carers. Various pharmacological interventions, including donepezil, galantamine, memantine and rivastigmine, appear to have some effect in treating cognitive decline in people without Down syndrome, but their effectiveness for those with Down syndrome remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of antiâ€êdementia pharmacological interventions and nutritional supplements for treating cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome. Search methods In January 2015, we searched CENTRAL, ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, seven other databases, and two trials registers. In addition, we checked the references of relevant reviews and studies and contacted study authors, other researchers and relevant drug manufacturers to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antiâ€êdementia pharmacological interventions or nutritional supplements for adults (aged 18 years and older) with Down syndrome, in which treatment was administered and compared with either placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted the relevant data. Review authors contacted study authors to obtain missing information where necessary. Main results Only nine studies (427 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four of these (192 participants) assessed the effectiveness of donepezil, two (139 participants) assessed memantine, one (21 participants) assessed simvastatin, one study (35 participants) assessed antioxidants, and one study (40 participants) assessed acetylâ€êLâ€êcarnitine. Five studies focused on adults aged 45 to 55 years, while the remaining four studies focused on adults aged 20 to 29 years. Seven studies were conducted in either the USA or UK, one between Norway and the UK, and one in Japan. Followâ€êup periods in studies ranged from four weeks to two years. The reviewers judged all included studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. Analyses indicate that for participants who received donepezil, scores in measures of cognitive functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) â€ê0.27 to 1.13) and measures of behaviour (SMD 0.42, 95% CI â€ê0.06 to 0.89) were similar to those who received placebo. However, participants who received donepezil were significantly more likely to experience an adverse event (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62). The quality of this body of evidence was low. None of the included donepezil studies reported data for carer stress, institutional/home care, or death. For participants who received memantine, scores in measures of cognitive functioning (SMD 0.05, 95% CI â€ê0.43 to 0.52), behaviour (SMD â€ê0.17, 95% CI â€ê0.46 to 0.11), and occurrence of adverse events (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17) were similar to those who received placebo. The quality of this body of evidence was low. None of the included memantine studies reported data for carer stress, institutional/home care, or death. Due to insufficient data, it was possible to provide a narrative account only of the outcomes for simvastatin, antioxidants, and acetylâ€êLâ€êcarnitine. Results from one pilot study suggest that participants who received simvastatin may have shown a slight improvement in cognitive measures. Authors' conclusions Due to the low quality of the body of evidence in this review, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of any pharmacological intervention for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome. Plain language summary Medications for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome People with Down syndrome often experience cognitive decline (a deterioration in memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal ageâ€êrelated changes) at a younger age and in greater numbers than the general population. Various medicines have been shown to improve, or at least slow down the progression of these symptoms in people without Down syndrome. Review question Do adults (18 years and older) with Down syndrome benefit from treatment with medicine to prevent cognitive decline, compared with other adults with Down syndrome who receive either fake medicine (placebos) or no medicine? Study characteristics In January 2015, we, a team of Cochrane researchers, searched for all medical studies that investigated the effect of any medicine or nutritional supplement on cognitive decline in adults with Down syndrome. We found nine relevant randomised controlled trials (this design produces the most reliable results) that we could include in this overview. These studies tested: â€ê donepezil, a medicine used to treat Alzheimer's disease (four studies); â€ê memantine, a medicine used to treat Alzheimer's disease (two studies); â€ê simvastatin, a (statin) medicine used to prevent heart disease (one study); â€ê a mixture of antioxidants, including forms of vitamins C and E, and alphaâ€êlipoic acid (one study); and â€ê acetylâ€êLâ€êcarnitine, a dietary supplement that has previously been used to treat dementia (one study). Five of the studies focused on adults aged 45 to 55 years and four focused on adults aged 20 to 29 years. Seven studies were conducted in either the USA or UK, one took place in Norway and the UK, and one study was conducted in Japan. Key results The nine studies we found examined the effects of five medicines that are, or have been, used to prevent cognitive decline. All the studies compared the medicine being tested with a placebo (a tablet or capsule that looked and tasted like the medicine, but which contained no medicine). Generally, those who received the medicine did no better than those who received the placebo in any of the areas assessed in the studies. The areas assessed included general functioning (including memory and thinking, speech, mood and behaviour); cognitive functioning (including memory, following whatâ€™s going on around you); adaptive behaviours (being able to do dayâ€êtoâ€êday tasks); or behaviour problems (such as being irritable or aggressive). The only medicine to show any positive effect was the statin, simvastatin. Preliminary findings from a very small study showed that simvastin had some benefit on improving memory compared to placebo. In the four donepezil studies, those participants given donepezil reported more headaches, dizziness, and nausea than participants given placebo. In the two memantine studies, there was no difference between participants given memantine or placebo for reports of headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Quality of the evidence Although the included studies were well conducted, most involved small numbers of participants and for many of the areas assessed we could not combine results from two or more studies. Overall, the quality of this evidence is low. We cannot be certain whether any of these medicines are effective. Running more trials with more people over a longer period of time would allow us answer this question with greater certainty. We could not find any trials that investigated many of the medicines used to prevent cognitive decline, and so research is needed to explore the effectiveness of these medications in the Down syndrome population.",2015,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,10,, CD011546, 10.1002/14651858.CD011546.pub2,,#6,Livingstone 2015
Cochrane, Management of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central neurological diseases," Coggrave, M;  Norton, C;  Cody, JD"," Abstract - Background People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with any management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 and 2006. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (postâ€êtraumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Objectives To determine the effects of management strategies for faecal incontinence and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials Register (searched 8 June 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE Inâ€êProcess as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€êrandomised trials evaluating any type of conservative or surgical intervention for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury were selected. Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction were also considered. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of preâ€êspecified outcome measures. Main results Twenty trials involving 902 people were included. Oral medications There was evidence from individual small trials that people with Parkinson's disease had a statistically significant improvement in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines per week when fibre (psyllium) (mean difference (MD) â€ê2.2 bowel motions, 95% confidence interval (CI) â€ê3.3 to â€ê1.4) or oral laxative (isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution) (MD 2.9 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.32) are used compared with placebo. One trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time comparing intramuscular neostigmineâ€êglycopyrrolate (anticholinesterase plus an anticholinergic drug) with placebo (MD 23.3 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 41.92). Five studies reported the use of cisapride and tegaserod in people with spinal cord injuries or Parkinson's disease. These drugs have since been withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects; as they are no longer available they have been removed from this review. Rectal stimulants One small trial in people with spinal cord injuries compared two bisacodyl suppositories, one polyethylene glycolâ€êbased (PGB) and one hydrogenated vegetable oilâ€êbased (HVB). The trial found that the PGB bisacodyl suppository significantly reduced the mean defaecation period (PGB 20 minutes versus HVB 36 minutes, P < 0.03) and mean total time for bowel care (PGB 43 minutes versus HVB 74.5 minutes, P < 0.01) compared with the HVB bisacodyl suppository. Physical interventions There was evidence from one small trial with 31 participants that abdominal massage statistically improved the number of bowel motions in people who had a stroke compared with no massage (MD 1.7 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 2.22 to 1.18). A small feasibility trial including 30 individuals with multiple sclerosis also found evidence to support the use of abdominal massage. Constipation scores were statistically better with the abdominal massage during treatment although this was not supported by a change in outcome measures (for example the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score). One small trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time using electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles compared with no electrical stimulation (MD 29.3 minutes, 95% CI 7.35 to 51.25). There was evidence from one trial with a low risk of bias that for people with spinal cord injury transanal irrigation, compared against conservative bowel care, statistically improved constipation scores, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care (MD 27.4 minutes, 95% CI 7.96 to 46.84). Patients were also more satisfied with this method. Other interventions In one trial in stroke patients, there appeared to be a short term benefit (less than six months) to patients in terms of the number of bowel motions per week with a oneâ€êoff educational intervention from nurses (a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care), but this did not persist at 12 months. A trial in individuals with spinal cord injury found that a stepwise protocol did not reduce the need for oral laxatives and manual evacuation of stool. Finally, one further trial reported in abstract form showed that oral carbonated water (rather than tap water) improved constipation scores in people who had had a stroke. Authors' conclusions There is still remarkably little research on this common and, to patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other. There was very limited evidence from individual trials in favour of a bulkâ€êforming laxative (psyllium), an isosmotic macrogol laxative, abdominal massage, electrical stimulation and an anticholinesteraseâ€êanticholinergic drug combination (neostigmineâ€êglycopyrrolate) compared to no treatment or controls. There was also evidence in favour of transanal irrigation (compared to conservative management), oral carbonated (rather than tap) water and abdominal massage with lifestyle advice (compared to lifestyle advice alone). However, these findings need to be confirmed by larger wellâ€êdesigned controlled trials which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life. Plain language summary Management of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central nervous system diseases Individuals with central nervous system disease or injury have a much higher risk of loss of bowel control and severe constipation than other people. This is called neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD). It can be very difficult to treat constipation without causing bowel leakage, or to prevent bowel leakage without causing constipation. The time spent on emptying the bowel is nearly always much greater for these individuals. Bowel problems like this cause a lot of anxiety and distress and can reduce the quality of life of those who suffer them. This review of research about NBD could be of interest to individuals with any damage to the central nervous system caused by disease or injury, or present at birth, which has a long term effect on how their bowel works. While there is a great deal of information on the causes of NBD, there are few studies that focus on how to practically manage the problem. Currently the usual advice is to have a good fluid intake, a balanced diet, as much physical exercise as is practical and a regular planned bowel routine. A bowel routine may include use of oral laxative medicines, suppositories or enemas; abdominal massage; digital rectal stimulation and digital evacuation of stool. The steps used will depend on the needs of each individual and some degree of trial and error is usually needed to achieve a satisfactory routine. Only research studies where participants were allocated to either the control group (who received either no intervention or usual care) or the treatment group by chance (called randomisation) were included in this review as these studies provide the most reliable evidence. Fifteen new studies have been added in this update. Five have been removed because the drugs the studies reported on (cisapride and tegaserod) have been withdrawn from the market and are no longer available. Most of the 20 randomised studies in this review included very small numbers of participants and the study reports did not always give the information needed to be sure that the study findings were reliable. Some oral laxatives were found to improve bowel function including psyllium, a stoolâ€êbulking laxative (one study), and an isosmotic macrogol (one study), which were both studied in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Some suppositories and microâ€êenemas used to help the bowel to open produced faster results than others (three studies) and the timing of suppository use may affect the response of the bowel (one study). Digital evacuation of stool may be more effective than oral or rectal medication (one study). The use of transanal irrigation in individuals with spinal cord injury improved bowel control, constipation and quality of life measures (one study). Three studies found that abdominal massage was helpful in reducing constipation. One study found that patients may benefit from even one educational contact with a nurse. This review shows that there is still remarkably little research on this common problem which is so important to patients. The research evidence found by the review is generally very poor because the way the studies were carried out and reported means that the results are not reliable. It is not possible to make recommendations for care based on these studies. Managing NBD will continue to rely on trial and error until more high quality studies with larger numbers of participants and which examine the most important aspects of this problem are carried out.",2014,, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,,1,, CD002115, 10.1002/14651858.CD002115.pub5,,#1,Coggrave 2014
